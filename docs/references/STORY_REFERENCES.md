## 🎬 TIER 3 — Patterns from "Alone" TV Show (Most Dramatic)

### Key Dramatic Patterns to Use:

| Pattern | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Hoarding while starving** | Dave Nessia (S3) — stockpiled smoked fish but his body was shutting down. BMI of 16.1. | Psychological horror. The mind refuses to eat what it saved. |
| **89 days then frostbite** | Callie Russell (S7) — survived 89 brutal days in the Arctic, then medically evacuated for severe frostbite on toes | So close to winning, then the body betrays you |
| **Cut tendon while chopping** | Mary Kate Green (S2) — accidentally cut a tendon in her arm with an axe while chopping firewood | One swing. One mistake. Done. |
| **Evacuated in hours** | Desmond White (S2) — heard bear noises, saw bear scat, tapped out within HOURS | Fear is the real enemy, not cold |
| **Overly ambitious build** | Multiple contestants — built log cabins that consumed too many calories, leading to evacuation | The irony of dying because you built too well |
| **Wrong location choice** | Multiple — built in low-lying cold sinks or boggy ground | The invisible mistake that kills slowly |
| **Chimney failure** | Adam Riley (S9) — had to improvise a chimney from willow and clay | When the smoke won't leave, neither can you |

### Best Alone Shelter Strategies (for realistic story generation):
- **Roland Welker (S7 winner):** Built a "rock house" using thermal mass — stored heat in rocks
- **Teimojin Tan (S9):** Multi-layered debris shelter with rolled moss "bricks" for insulation
- **Excavated shelters:** Partially underground = better insulated but massive calorie cost

## 🧬 Story DNA — Patterns That Make Stories Viral

### 1. The Promise
Someone made a commitment to another person (spouse, child, parent). Now they must deliver.
- *"I told my wife I'd build us a home before winter. She's dying."*

### 2. The Last Chance
This is the character's final opportunity. Age, health, or circumstances make it now or never.
- *"He was 62. His knees were giving out. One more winter of building, or never."*

### 3. The Aftermath
The story starts AFTER destruction. Rebuild from ruins.
- *"The storm took everything. The cabin. The tools. The food. But not the foundation."*

### 4. The Inherited Burden
Someone inherits a project or property. It's in ruins. They must restore it.
- *"His grandfather's cabin had been abandoned for 30 years. He found a letter inside."*

### 5. The Wrong Season
Building in the worst possible conditions. Time is the enemy.
- *"Nobody builds in January. He had no choice."*

### 6. The Solitary Vigil
Not building — surviving. Alone, waiting for rescue or weather to break.
- *"Day 14 in someone else's abandoned cabin. The firewood ran out yesterday."*

### 7. The Community Build
Not solo — a group. But personalities clash. The tension is BETWEEN people.
- *"Three strangers. One cabin. 60 days. They hated each other by day 5."*

### 8. The Obsession
Someone who can't stop building. It consumes them. The project becomes bigger than rational.
- *"He rebuilt the same cabin five times. His wife left by the third."*

### 9. The Silent Witness
The story follows someone or something else — a dog, a neighbor, a diary. Not the builder's perspective.
- *"Koda watched Erik from the snowdrift. The man hadn't eaten in two days."*

### 10. The Failure
The cabin is never finished. Or it fails. Or the person gives up. The value is in what they learned.
- *"On day 47, he stacked his tools by the door and walked away."*

## 🎯 What Makes Our Stories Different from "Basic"

| ❌ Basic/Trillado | ✅ What We Need |
|---|---|
| Man builds cabin alone ✓ | Man builds cabin **because his daughter won't speak to him** |
| Tormenta hits ✓ | Storm reveals **a design flaw he knew about but ignored** |
| He finishes on time ✓ | He finishes but **realizes the cabin was never the point** |
| Happy ending always | **3 types of endings:** triumph, bittersweet, and failure |
| Single conflict (weather) | **Layered conflicts:** internal + weather + supply + relationship |
| Generic protagonist | **Specific person:** age, scars, accent, favorite tool, fear |
| "42 days" | **"42 days. But day 28 is the one that broke him."** |
