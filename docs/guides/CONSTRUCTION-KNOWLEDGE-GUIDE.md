# CONSTRUCTION & SURVIVAL KNOWLEDGE GUIDE
## Complete Reference for Writing Realistic Cabin-Building & Wilderness Survival Scripts

---

## PURPOSE

This document contains ALL the construction, engineering, and survival knowledge needed to write scripts that feel REAL. A viewer who has actually built a cabin or survived in the wilderness should not be able to find a factual error. Every material, tool, technique, phase, problem, and physical reality described here comes from real-world sources: Dick Proenneke's journals, Alone TV seasons, Reddit r/Bushcraft, historical construction documents (Wisconsin 1843, Wind River 1834), and professional builders.

Use this as your reference bible when writing survival/construction scripts.

## PART 1: LOG CABIN CONSTRUCTION — THE COMPLETE SEQUENCE

### The 10 Phases (in STRICT order)

You CANNOT skip phases or reorder them. Each phase depends on the previous one being complete.

```
PHASE 1:  SITE SELECTION & SURVEY
PHASE 2:  LAND CLEARING
PHASE 3:  MATERIAL SOURCING (trees, stones, etc.)
PHASE 4:  FOUNDATION
PHASE 5:  WALL CONSTRUCTION (log stacking)
PHASE 6:  ROOF FRAMING
PHASE 7:  ROOF COVERING & WATERPROOFING
PHASE 8:  CHINKING & SEALING (gaps between logs)
PHASE 9:  INSULATION
PHASE 10: HEATING SYSTEM (stove/chimney/fireplace)
```

You can overlap some phases (e.g., sourcing materials while clearing), but the STRUCTURAL sequence is inviolable: foundation → walls → roof → seal → heat.

---

### PHASE 1: SITE SELECTION & SURVEY

**What happens:** The character walks the terrain, evaluates multiple spots, and chooses where to build.

**Critical decisions (each is a potential story beat):**
- **Elevation:** NEVER build in a low-lying area. Cold air sinks. A cabin in a valley floor can be 15-20°F colder than 100 yards uphill. (Source: Wind River 1834 — Jonas Fletcher built in a cold sink, burned 3× more firewood than anyone)
- **Drainage:** Ground must slope AWAY from the building site. If water pools during snowmelt, the foundation will rot within 2 years.
- **Wind exposure:** Face the door AWAY from prevailing winds. In the Northern Hemisphere, the worst winter winds typically come from the northwest.
- **Sun exposure:** South-facing clearing = maximum winter sun (crucial for warmth and morale). North-facing = perpetual shadow in winter months.
- **Water source:** Within 200m of a creek or spring, but NOT directly next to it (flooding risk, condensation dampness).
- **Tree access:** Close to standing timber for ongoing firewood and building materials. Hauling logs is the most calorie-expensive part of building.
- **Ground type:** Avoid pure clay (heaves in freeze-thaw), peat/bog (absorbs water), or pure sand (no structural support). Best: mixed mineral soil with rock underneath.

**Tools needed:** None special — this is a walking/planning phase. Maybe a compass, a level, and rope for measuring.

**Time:** 1-3 days for an experienced builder. A novice might take a week before committing.

**Story potential:**
- Character chooses wrong site, discovers the error later (cold sink, drainage problem, wind exposure)
- Two good options, agonizing decision
- The "perfect" spot has one fatal flaw (rocky ground, no drainage, bear den nearby)

---

### PHASE 2: LAND CLEARING

**What happens:** Remove brush, saplings, small trees, rocks, and debris from the building site and immediate surroundings.

**Real sequence within clearing:**
1. Remove small brush and saplings first (axe, swing low, horizontal cuts)
2. Cut larger small trees (under 6" diameter) at base
3. Remove stumps if possible, or cut flush to ground
4. Clear debris — drag cut brush to burn pile or stack at perimeter
5. Level the ground surface roughly with shovel
6. Clear a perimeter around the build site (fire safety, visibility, drainage)

**Tools:**
| Tool | Use | Detail |
|------|-----|--------|
| Axe | Cutting saplings, small trees, brush | Low swings for brush, overhead for trees |
| Machete/billhook | Clearing thin brush, vines, willow thickets | Faster than axe for thin material |
| Shovel | Removing roots, leveling earth | Flat blade for cutting roots |
| Rake | Clearing debris after cutting | |
| Saw (bow saw or crosscut) | Trees over 6" diameter | Axe alone is inefficient for thick wood |

**Time:** 2-5 days for a 30-40 m² clearing, depending on brush density.

**Physical reality:**
- Clearing is EXHAUSTING — constant bending, swinging, dragging
- Produces massive amounts of debris that must be moved
- The ground underneath is often uneven, with hidden rocks and roots
- Progress is slow and demoralizing — after a full day, you've cleared maybe 20-30 m²
- Blisters form on hands within hours if not calloused
- Bug exposure is maximum during clearing (disturbing ground = swarms)

**Story potential:**
- Underestimating how long clearing takes (everyone does)
- Finding something unexpected under the brush (old foundation, animal den, spring)
- The physical transformation begins here — soft hands become raw

---

### PHASE 3: MATERIAL SOURCING

**What happens:** Selecting, felling, processing, and transporting building materials.

**For a log cabin, you need:**
- **Wall logs:** 40-80 logs, 8-12" diameter, 12-20 feet long (depending on cabin size)
- **Foundation logs:** 4-8 of the thickest, straightest, most rot-resistant logs available
- **Roof beams:** Ridge pole + rafters, typically 6-8" diameter
- **Chinking material:** Moss, clay, sawdust, or combination
- **Insulation:** Moss, birch bark, animal hide, straw — depends on location
- **Stones:** For foundation piers, chimney, or fire pit

**Tree selection rules:**
- Standing DEAD trees are preferred — already dry, lighter to handle, won't shrink as much
- If using green (living) wood: it will shrink 5-10% as it dries → gaps appear between logs
- Spruce is the most common cabin log — straight, lightweight, rot-resistant
- Pine is good but heavier and sappier
- Cedar/larch are excellent (naturally rot-resistant) but harder to find in most locations
- NEVER use birch for structural logs — beautiful but rots quickly
- Birch bark is EXCELLENT for waterproofing and insulation

**Felling a tree (correct technique):**
1. Plan the fall direction (lean of tree + wind + clear landing zone)
2. Cut a notch on the FALL SIDE (1/3 of trunk depth)
3. Make the back cut from the OPPOSITE side, slightly above the notch bottom
4. Leave a hinge of uncut wood (2" or so) — the tree pivots on this
5. Tree falls in the notch direction
6. **DANGER:** "Widow makers" — dead branches that fall when the tree shakes. ALWAYS look up before cutting.
7. After felling: limb the tree (remove all branches), cut to length, peel bark

**Log processing:**
- Debarking: drawknife or bark spud along the length of the log. Green logs peel easier.
- Drying: ideally stack off the ground with spacers between logs ("stickering") for airflow. Takes 6-12 months for full drying. Most builders can't wait this long — they build with green wood and deal with shrinkage.
- Notching: done at each corner where logs interlock. Types:
  - **Saddle notch:** Most common. Scoop-shaped notch on the underside. Quick but less tight.
  - **Dovetail:** Flared notch that locks tighter as the log shrinks. More complex to cut.
  - **V-notch:** Simple but less weather-resistant.
  - **Scandinavian cope (full scribe):** The log is scribed to match the exact contour of the log below. Tightest fit. Requires skill.

**Transportation:**
- Horses, ATVs, or trucks for long distances
- Peavey (lever tool with hook) for rolling and positioning
- Cant hook for rotating logs
- Ramps and skids for lifting onto walls
- A single person can lift a 10-foot spruce log (8" diameter) but it's at the limit (~200 lbs)
- Logs over 12" or over 16 feet — you NEED a mechanical advantage (ramp, pulley, lever)

**Time:** 
- Felling + limbing + debarking one log: 45-90 minutes
- Full cabin's worth of logs (60 logs): 2-4 weeks if working alone
- This is the most time-consuming phase

---

### PHASE 4: FOUNDATION

**What happens:** Creating a level, stable, dry base for the cabin to rest on.

**Foundation types for wilderness cabins:**

| Type | Best for | Complexity | Duration |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Log sill on ground** | Temporary shelters | Low | 1-2 days |
| **Stone piers** | Most cabins | Medium | 3-5 days |
| **Dry-stacked stone wall** | Permanent, cold climates | High | 1-2 weeks |
| **Gravel pad** | If gravel available | Medium | 3-5 days |
| **Post and beam** | Sloped terrain | Medium | 3-5 days |

**Critical rules:**
- The foundation MUST be level. Even 2 inches off will make walls unstable and doors impossible.
- The first sill logs must be the most rot-resistant wood available (or treated with char)
- The bottom of the cabin must be ABOVE ground level to prevent moisture wicking
- Drainage trench around the foundation perimeter → directs water AWAY
- In permafrost regions: the foundation must NOT conduct heat into the ground, or the permafrost melts and the cabin sinks

**Stone pier method (most common):**
1. Dig holes at each corner and mid-span points (below frost line if possible)
2. Fill with stones, layered and packed
3. Top stone must be flat and level
4. Lay first sill log across the piers
5. Check level in BOTH directions
6. Shim with flat stones as needed

**Common problems:**
- Ground that LOOKS level but isn't (use a level + string line)
- Frost heave: when the ground freezes, moisture in the soil expands and lifts the foundation unevenly. Solution: dig below frost line, or use a floating foundation.
- Rot: the sill logs (bottom logs touching the foundation) rot first. Solutions: use naturally rot-resistant wood, char the bottoms, or place bark/stone barriers.
- Settling: new foundation settles over time → cabin shifts, doors stick, gaps open

**Tools:** Shovel, pickaxe, level, string line, hammer/mallet, pry bar

**Time:** 3-7 days for a typical cabin foundation

---

### PHASE 5: WALL CONSTRUCTION

**What happens:** Stacking logs on top of each other, notching corners so they interlock, creating walls.

**The wall-raising process (per course/layer):**
1. Select the next log — try to alternate thick and thin ends for uniform wall height
2. Cut the corner notch on BOTH ends to match the log below
3. Lift the log into position (this is where it gets physically brutal)
4. Check that the wall is plumb (vertical) with each new course
5. Secure temporarily if needed
6. Repeat for all four walls simultaneously — go up one course at a time around the entire perimeter

**Key concepts:**
- **Course:** One layer of logs all the way around (4 logs per course on a rectangular cabin)
- **Fly:** The amount each log extends past the corner notch. Typically 6-12 inches. Creates the classic cabin silhouette.
- **Crown up/Crown down:** Each log has a natural bow. Some builders place the crown (high point) up, some down. Crown down lets moisture drain. Crown up reduces settling.

**Lifting methods as walls get higher:**
- First 3-4 courses: lift by hand (two people ideal, one person possible)
- Courses 5-8: use ramps (logs leaned against the wall at 30-45° angle) and roll the log up
- Courses 9+: need gin poles, A-frame hoists, block and tackle, or vehicle winch
- A single person building beyond 5 courses ALONE is extremely difficult and dangerous

**Wall height:**
- Typical cabin: 7-9 courses per wall = 6-8 feet of wall height
- Each log adds 8-12 inches of height (after notching removes 2-3 inches)
- Door and window openings are cut AFTER the wall is stacked, or planned with shorter logs

**Openings (doors and windows):**
- Option A: Stack full logs, then chainsaw-cut the opening later (easier but feels wasteful)
- Option B: Use shorter logs around openings, framing as you go (harder, more precise)
- After cutting an opening: install a frame (buck) to prevent log ends from spreading
- Leave expansion gap at top of frame — logs settle/shrink as they dry

**Common problems:**
- Logs rolling off during lifting (DANGEROUS — a 200lb log falling is lethal)
- Twisted or bowed logs that won't sit flat (split them for other uses, don't force them)
- Wall going out of plumb (leaning) — check EVERY course
- Rot in one log discovered after it's already in the wall
- Green logs shrinking and opening gaps (see chinking, Phase 8)
- Running out of similar-sized logs (have to fell more mid-construction)

**Tools:** Axe, chainsaw (if available), chisel, mallet, drawknife, peavey/cant hook, level, string line, measuring tape

**Time:** 
- One course per day (4 logs) is average for a solo builder
- Full walls (8 courses): 2-3 weeks solo, 1-1.5 weeks with help
- This is where the physical toll is heaviest — constant heavy lifting

---

### PHASE 6: ROOF FRAMING

**What happens:** Creating the skeleton of the roof structure.

**Components:**
1. **Top plate (cap log):** The final log on each wall. Must be especially straight and strong.
2. **Gable ends:** The triangular wall sections at each end of the cabin (if gable roof)
3. **Ridge pole:** The horizontal beam at the very top/peak. The longest, strongest single timber.
4. **Rafters:** Logs or hewn beams angling from the ridge pole down to the walls. Spaced 18-24" apart.
5. **Purlins:** Horizontal beams running between rafters (optional, adds rigidity)

**Roof pitch (angle) matters enormously:**
- **Less than 30°:** Snow accumulates, ice dams form, water pools → leaks guaranteed
- **35-40°:** Minimum for heavy snow regions. Snow can still build up.
- **45°+:** Snow slides off on its own. Best for heavy snowfall areas. But requires longer rafters.
- **60°+:** Almost no snow accumulation. Used in extreme snowfall regions (Japan, Scandinavia). Very tall gable ends.

**The ridge pole challenge:**
- This is typically the single heaviest, longest timber in the build
- It sits at the highest point — must be lifted to the peak
- Methods: A-frame with block and tackle, gin poles, progressive lifting with supports
- For a solo builder, this is often THE most dangerous moment of the entire build
- Dick Proenneke solved this with an A-frame and cable hoist he built himself

**Common problems:**
- Ridge pole too heavy for available lifting equipment
- Rafter spacing too wide → roof sags under snow load
- Wrong pitch → catastrophic snow accumulation (the "17 leaks" scenario)
- Gable end logs splitting or bowing under the weight of the ridge pole

**Tools:** Saw, axe, chisel, rope, block and tackle, measuring tape, level

**Time:** 3-7 days for framing. This phase feels faster than walls because it's exciting — the cabin starts looking like a CABIN.

---

### PHASE 7: ROOF COVERING & WATERPROOFING

**What happens:** Making the roof actually keep water and snow out.

**Covering methods (from simple to complex):**

| Method | Durability | Complexity | Weight |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Tarp** | Months | Easiest | Light |
| **Birch bark sheets** | 10-20 years | Medium | Light |
| **Split log shingles (shakes)** | 20-40 years | High | Heavy |
| **Sod/earth roof** | Decades | Medium | Very heavy |
| **Sheet metal** | 50+ years | Medium (if you have it) | Medium |

**Birch bark roofing (traditional method):**
1. Harvest large sheets of birch bark in spring/early summer (bark peels easiest when sap is flowing)
2. Lay bark sheets in overlapping rows, starting from the bottom (like shingles)
3. Weight down with poles or thin logs
4. The natural oils in birch bark make it naturally waterproof

**Split log shingles:**
1. Select straight-grained logs (cedar, pine, or spruce)
2. Cut into 18-24" bolts (sections)
3. Split with a froe and mallet into thin pieces (1/2" to 3/4" thick)
4. Lay in overlapping courses, stagger the joints
5. Secure with wooden pegs or nails
6. 200-400 shingles needed for a typical cabin roof

**Waterproofing layers (best practice):**
```
TOP:     Shingles or bark (outer weather layer)
MIDDLE:  Birch bark sheets (waterproof membrane)
BOTTOM:  Moss or sawdust (insulation layer)
BASE:    Pole rafters and purlins (structure)
```

**Common problems:**
- Leaks at the ridge line (where two roof planes meet at the top) — the hardest spot to seal
- Ice dams: heat from inside melts snow on the roof, water runs down and refreezes at the cold eave → water backs up under the shingles
- Sap dripping from green wood rafters
- Wind lifting light roofing materials (bark, tarp)
- Snow load exceeding roof capacity → catastrophic collapse

**Tools:** Axe, froe (for splitting shingles), mallet, knife, ladder, rope

**Time:** 3-10 days depending on method. Shingle-making is extremely time-consuming.

---

### PHASE 8: CHINKING & SEALING

**What happens:** Filling the gaps between logs to block wind, water, and insects.

**Why gaps exist:**
- Logs are round → the contact surface between two logs is only a thin line
- Green logs shrink as they dry → gaps open wider over time
- No two logs are perfectly straight → irregular gaps appear
- Notch joints are never perfect → small openings at corners

**Chinking materials:**

| Material | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Moss** | Free, abundant, good insulator | Dries and falls out, needs reapplying |
| **Moss + clay** | Better adhesion than moss alone | Can crack in freeze-thaw |
| **Clay + sand + fiber** | Most durable traditional method | Labor-intensive to mix |
| **Cal/lime + sand + animal hair** | Historically the best | Lime must be sourced/made |
| **Oakum (tarred fiber)** | Excellent sealant | Must be purchased |

**The Wisconsin 1843 chinking lesson:**
Samuel Whitmore used moss alone for his first chinking. Rain washed it out within weeks. Second attempt: moss + clay. Cracked in the first freeze. Third attempt: lime, sand, and horse hair mixed to a mortar-like consistency. Lasted decades. **Lesson: chinking takes 3 tries on average.**

**Application process:**
1. Stuff the large gaps first with moss or rags (backing material)
2. Mix chinking compound to a thick paste
3. Press firmly into gaps using a trowel, stick, or gloved hands
4. Smooth the surface — the outer face should be slightly concave (sheds water)
5. Let dry/cure for several days
6. Check for cracks and reapply
7. **CRITICAL:** Apply from BOTH inside and outside for full seal

**Common problems:**
- Chinking falling out after first rain (wrong material or not enough depth)
- Freeze-thaw cracking (moisture in chinking expands when frozen)
- Insects nesting in moss chinking
- The SMELL of improperly cured clay chinking in a sealed cabin
- Having to RE-chink after the first winter (almost guaranteed with green logs)

**Time:** 2-4 days for initial chinking, plus ongoing maintenance

---

### PHASE 9: INSULATION

**What happens:** Adding thermal barriers to keep heat in and cold out.

**Where insulation matters most (in order):**
1. **Roof** — Heat rises. An uninsulated roof = losing 40-50% of heat
2. **Floor** — Cold ground conducts heat away. Direct contact = frozen feet
3. **Walls** — Log walls provide some inherent insulation (R-value of ~1.5 per inch of wood)
4. **Around doors and windows** — Air infiltration points are worst at openings

**Natural insulation materials:**

| Material | R-value/inch | Availability | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Dry moss** | ~2.5 | Forest floor | Must be BONE DRY or it conducts cold |
| **Birch bark** | ~3.0 | Birch trees | Also a vapor barrier |
| **Straw/grass** | ~1.5 | Meadows | Fire risk if near stove |
| **Animal fur/hide** | ~3.5 | Hunting | Small quantities only |
| **Wood shavings/sawdust** | ~2.5 | Log processing waste | Settles over time, needs containment |
| **Snow** | ~1.0 | Winter | Igloos work because air pockets in snow insulate |
| **Earth/sod** | ~0.5 | Everywhere | Heavy but excellent thermal mass |

**Floor insulation method:**
1. Lay log sleepers on the foundation
2. Fill between sleepers with dry moss/sawdust
3. Lay floor boards (split logs, flat side up)
4. Alternative: packed earth floor with animal hide rugs (simpler but colder)

**Roof insulation method:**
1. Lay birch bark sheets over rafters (waterproof + insulation)
2. Add thick layer of dry moss (6-12 inches)
3. Cover with second layer of birch bark or wood
4. Top with shingles or final roofing

**Common problems:**
- Moisture in insulation = worse than no insulation (wet moss conducts cold)
- Animal nesting in moss insulation (mice, marmots, insects)
- Settling over time (sawdust compresses, losing R-value)
- Fire risk near stove pipe penetrations

**Time:** 2-5 days, integrated with other phases

---

### PHASE 10: HEATING SYSTEM

**What happens:** Installing the stove, chimney, or fireplace that will keep the cabin habitable.

**Heating options:**

| Type | Heat output | Complexity | Fuel demand |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Open fireplace** | Low (80% heat goes up chimney) | High | Very high |
| **Cast iron wood stove** | High (radiates in all directions) | Medium | Moderate |
| **Masonry heater (Finnish style)** | Very high (thermal mass stores heat) | Very high | Low per day |
| **Stone fireplace with thermal mass** | High | High | Moderate |
| **Rocket stove** | Moderate | Medium | Low |

**Chimney construction (the most dangerous system):**
- Must extend at least 2 feet above the roof peak (prevents downdrafts)
- Must have correct DRAW (draft): the hot air rising through the chimney pulls fresh air into the fire
- Wrong chimney dimensions = smoke fills the cabin instead of going up and out
- Chimney fire (creosote buildup ignites) = can burn the cabin down

**Chimney materials:**
- Stone and clay mortar (traditional, excellent thermal mass)
- Stacked stone with clay lining (requires frequent re-lining)
- Metal stovepipe (modern, efficient, less thermal mass)
- Willow frame packed with clay (emergency/primitive — SHORT lifespan)

**The thermal mass principle (from Wind River 1834):**
Jonas Fletcher burned 3× more firewood than anyone because his chimney was thin brick with no thermal mass. Solution: surround the fireplace/stove with river stones. The stones absorb heat during the fire and radiate it for hours after the fire dies. Roland Welker (Alone S7) used this principle — built a "rock house" where heated stones continued warming the shelter overnight.

**Creosote: the invisible killer**
- When wood burns incompletely (smoldering, green/wet wood), it creates creosote — a tar-like substance that coats the inside of the chimney
- Creosote buildup restricts airflow → more smoke, less heat
- If creosote gets thick enough and hot enough → chimney fire (catastrophic)
- Prevention: burn DRY wood at HIGH temperature. Clean chimney regularly.
- In extreme cold, creosote can FREEZE in the upper chimney → complete blockage

**Common problems:**
- Smoke filling the cabin = wrong chimney height, wrong pipe diameter, or insufficient draft
- Creosote buildup = burning wet/green wood
- Sparks on roof = fire hazard (need a spark arrestor)
- Carbon monoxide = incomplete combustion (LETHAL, odorless)
- Chimney freezing in extreme cold = condensation freezes inside the pipe
- Stove pipe penetration through wall/roof = must be properly insulated or fire risk

**The first fire is ALWAYS an event:**
- Brian in "Hatchet" takes 2 DAYS to make fire (sparks from axe on rock → birch bark tinder)
- Proenneke DESIGNED his fireplace like an engineer — calculated draw, height, mass
- The moment the first flame catches is the emotional climax of any build story
- In a new chimney, the first few fires should be SMALL to cure the clay/mortar gradually

**Tools:** Trowel, stone hammer, level, metal pipe (if available), fireplace grate

**Time:** 3-10 days depending on chimney type. Stone chimney = longest.

## PART 2: TOOLS & THEIR CORRECT USES

### Master Tool Reference

| Tool | Primary Use | NEVER Use For | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Axe (felling)** | Felling trees, splitting large wood | Hammering nails/stakes | 3-5 lb head, 28-36" handle |
| **Axe (hatchet)** | Small branch removal, kindling, notching | Heavy felling | 1.5 lb head, 14-19" handle |
| **Crosscut saw (two-person)** | Felling large trees (>12" diameter) | Ripping (lengthwise cuts) | Requires two operators |
| **Bow saw** | Medium trees (6-12"), cutting logs to length | Fine detail work | One-person operation |
| **Chainsaw** | All sawing (if fuel available) | Fine notching, delicate cuts | Modern luxury, not always available |
| **Drawknife** | Debarking logs, shaping flat surfaces | Splitting | Pulled toward user, seated work |
| **Froe** | Splitting shingles from bolts | Anything else | Struck with mallet, creates thin sheets |
| **Chisel** | Notching, mortise cutting, detail work | Splitting logs | Hit with mallet, NEVER hammer |
| **Mallet** | Driving stakes, hitting chisels, fitting joints | Metal nails | Wood or rawhide head |
| **Hammer** | Nails, metal stakes, metal hardware | Chisels (use mallet) | Steel head, wood handle |
| **Shovel** | Digging, leveling, moving earth/gravel | Prying | Flat blade = leveling; pointed = digging |
| **Pickaxe** | Breaking frozen ground, rocky soil | General digging (use shovel) | Essential in cold climates |
| **Peavey** | Rolling/positioning large logs | Lifting (no leverage) | Hook + spike at end of pole |
| **Cant hook** | Rotating logs (like a peavey without the spike) | Lifting | Better for log positioning |
| **Level** | Checking horizontal/vertical alignment | Measuring distance | Spirit level or plumb bob |
| **Tape measure/marked stick** | Measuring dimensions | Anything else | String line for longer distances |
| **Adze** | Flattening log surfaces (for floors/benches) | Felling | Perpendicular blade, swung downward |
| **Knife** | Cutting rope/twine, whittling, small tasks | Batoning heavy wood (risks snapping) | Every builder carries one |
| **Rope/cordage** | Lashing, lifting, measuring, securing | Structural support (rots over time) | Hemp, manila, or nylon |
| **Block & tackle** | Multiplying lifting force for heavy beams | Quick lifting (too slow) | Essential for ridge pole |

### Sharpening (often overlooked):
- An axe needs sharpening every 1-2 HOURS of active use
- A dull axe is MORE dangerous than a sharp one (bounces instead of biting)
- Sharpening method: file in the field, whetstone for fine edge
- Chainsaw chains: need filing every tank of fuel in dirty wood

## PART 3: REALISTIC TIMELINES

### Solo Builder (One Person, Hand Tools)

| Task | Optimistic | Realistic | Slow/Difficult |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Site selection | 1 day | 2-3 days | 1 week |
| Clearing the land (30m²) | 2 days | 3-5 days | 1 week |
| Felling + processing 60 logs | 10 days | 2-3 weeks | 4 weeks |
| Foundation | 2 days | 4-7 days | 10 days |
| Wall construction (8 courses) | 10 days | 2-3 weeks | 4 weeks |
| Roof framing | 2 days | 4-7 days | 10 days |
| Roof covering | 2 days | 4-7 days | 10 days |
| Chinking & sealing | 2 days | 3-5 days | 1 week |
| Insulation | 1 day | 2-4 days | 5 days |
| Heating system (stove + chimney) | 3 days | 5-10 days | 2 weeks |
| Door + window | 2 days | 3-5 days | 1 week |
| Floor | 1 day | 2-3 days | 5 days |
| **TOTAL** | **~38 days** | **~60-90 days** | **~120+ days** |

### With One Helper

Divide solo time by ~1.6 (not half — coordination overhead, waiting, different skill levels).

### Key Time Sinks People Underestimate:
1. **Material sourcing and transport:** Moving heavy logs from forest to site = 40% of total project time
2. **Shingle making:** 300 shingles × 10 min each = 50 HOURS of repetitive splitting
3. **Chimney construction:** Stone selection, fitting, mortar mixing, curing = much longer than expected
4. **Re-doing mistakes:** Plan for 15-20% of work being redone due to errors, rot discovery, weather damage
5. **Rest days:** A solo builder MUST rest every 4-5 days or injury risk skyrockets. Muscles need recovery.

## PART 4: MATERIALS BY REGION

### What's Available Where

| Region | Primary log | Foundation stone | Insulation | Roofing | Special materials |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Yukon/Alaska** | White spruce | River rock, granite | Moss, spruce boughs | Birch bark + sod | Permafrost challenges |
| **Scandinavia** | Pine, spruce | Granite | Moss, birch bark | Birch bark, sod | Traditional Scandinavian cope technique |
| **Siberia** | Larch (optimal), pine | River rock | Packed earth, moss | Bark, earth | Extreme cold = different build strategy |
| **British Columbia** | Western red cedar | River rock | Cedar bark, moss | Cedar shakes | Cedar = rot-resistant luxury |
| **Carpathians** | Oak, beech, spruce | Limestone | Straw, wool | Wooden shingles | Medieval techniques still alive |
| **Scotland** | Pine (limited), stone | Abundant | Heather, wool, sod | Slate, sod | Stone building > log building |
| **Patagonia** | Lenga beech, coigüe | River rock, volcanic | Grass, wool | Metal sheets, bark | Wind = primary enemy, not cold |
| **Japanese Alps** | Cedar (sugi), cypress | Stone | Straw (tatami), bark | Cedar bark, thatch | Snow loads → steep pitch mandatory |
| **Montana** | Douglas fir, lodgepole pine | Granite, river rock | Moss, sawdust | Wood shakes, metal | Abundant timber variety |
| **Finland** | Pine, spruce | Granite, fieldstone | Moss, birch bark | Birch bark, tar paper | Sauna culture = heated stone expertise |

## PART 5: THINGS THAT GO WRONG (REAL PROBLEMS FOR SCRIPTS)

### Foundation & Structure Problems

1. **Rotten sill logs** — discovered only after walls are partially up. Must tear down and replace. Costs 3-5 days.
2. **Frost heave** — foundation shifts unevenly as ground freezes/thaws. Doors stop closing. Walls crack.
3. **Settling** — green logs shrink → walls drop 2-4 inches in first year → doors/windows need re-framing.
4. **Insect damage** — carpenter ants or bark beetles eating structural logs from the inside. Discovered via sawdust piles.
5. **Wrong assessment of ground** — built on what seemed solid but turned out to be seasonal bog. Spring comes, cabin starts sinking.

### Roof Problems

6. **The wrong pitch** — 30° instead of 45° in snow country. Snow accumulates hundreds of pounds. Roof creaks. Eventually fails.
7. **Ice dams** — heat escaping through roof melts snow, refreezes at edge. Water backs up under shingles, leaks inside.
8. **Ridge leak** — the absolute hardest point to waterproof. Every rain finds the weakness.
9. **Wind uplift** — light roofing (bark, tarp) lifts in strong winds. The entire roof can peel off in a bad storm.

### Heating Problems

10. **Chimney won't draw** — smoke fills cabin. Usually: chimney too short, pipe too wide, or blockage. (Source: Adam Riley, Alone S9)
11. **Creosote fire** — buildup ignites inside chimney. Flames shoot out the top. Cabin at risk.
12. **Chimney freezing** — in extreme cold, moisture in rising gases freezes on cold chimney walls. Eventually blocks completely. (Source: Nikolai scenario)
13. **Carbon monoxide** — invisible, odorless. From smoldering fire with restricted airflow. Can kill you in your sleep.

### Sealing Problems

14. **Chinking failure** — traditional moss+clay washes out in first rain. Must be remixed with binding agent (hair, straw, lime).
15. **Gap expansion** — green logs dry, shrink, gaps between logs widen. First winter cold blasts through.
16. **Condensation inside walls** — warm inside air meets cold log surface → moisture → ice crystals on interior walls. Looks like frost. Caused by insufficient ventilation.

### Environmental Problems

17. **Bear destroying camp/shelter** — bears can tear apart walls, rip off doors, destroy food caches. (Source: Callie Russell, Alone S7)
18. **Flash flood** — creek that seemed peaceful rises 6 feet overnight. Foundation underwater. Tools washed away.
19. **Windstorm** — freak event destroys nearly-completed structure. 6 months of work gone in 6 hours. (Source: Alaska cabin incident)
20. **Avalanche/landslide** — geological event obliterates the site. Nothing can be salvaged. (Source: Norway 2022)
21. **Permafrost melting** — cabin's heat transmission melts the permafrost beneath, cabin tilts and sinks. (Specific to Arctic/sub-Arctic)

### Human & Physical Problems

22. **Injury** — a single axe miss, a dropped log on a foot, a fall from the wall. One injury can end the project. (Source: Mary Kate Green, Alone S2 — cut tendon while chopping)
23. **Calorie deficit** — building burns 4,000-6,000 calories/day. If food supply is limited, the body starts consuming muscle. Overly ambitious builds literally starve the builder. (Source: Alone TV pattern)
24. **Mental breakdown** — solitude + physical pain + slow progress + cold = psychological crisis. Talking to the dog. Obsessive journaling. Considering quitting.
25. **Tool failure** — axe handle snaps. Saw blade breaks. Chainsaw runs out of fuel with no resupply. Now what?

## PART 6: SURVIVAL REALISM

### The Body Deteriorates

Track physical deterioration throughout any multi-day story. Use at least 3-4 of these:

- **Hands:** Blisters (day 2-3) → calloused (day 7-10) → cracked and bleeding (day 15+) → permanently rough
- **Back:** Soreness (day 1) → chronic pain (day 7+) → can't straighten up in the morning (day 20+)
- **Weight loss:** Visible by day 10-14. Clothes hang looser. Face thins.
- **Skin:** Sunburn + windburn → chapped → weathered. Deep tan lines from work clothes.
- **Sleep:** Deteriorates with pain and cold. By day 20, falling asleep standing up during rest breaks.
- **Fingernails:** Cracked, blackened from impacts. One or two may fall off.
- **Feet:** Blisters → callouses → numbness in extreme cold → potential frostbite
- **Beard/hair:** Grows unkempt. Sap in hair from log work.
- **Cuts and scrapes:** Accumulate. In cold/wet climates, they don't heal properly.
- **Voice:** Changes from disuse (solo builders) or constant strain (calling to dog/companion)

### Hypothermia Stages (REAL medical progression)

| Stage | Temp (°F) | Symptoms | Story behavior |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Mild | 95-90 | Shivering, cold hands/feet, difficulty with fine motor | Drops tools, can't button jacket |
| Moderate | 90-82 | Violent shivering, confusion, slurred speech, poor decisions | Makes dangerous mistakes, forgets tool |
| Severe | 82-78 | Shivering STOPS (bad sign), delirium, paradoxical undressing | Calm but incoherent, starts removing clothes |
| Critical | Below 78 | Unconsciousness, barely detectable pulse/breathing | The dog lies on the character's chest |

**KEY:** The most terrifying symptom is when shivering STOPS. That means the body has given up trying to warm itself. Most people think stopping shivering = warming up. It means the opposite.

### Calorie Reality

| Activity | Calories/hour | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Felling trees (axe) | 400-600 | Highest calorie burn |
| Log hauling/lifting | 350-500 | Depends on weight/distance |
| Digging (frozen ground) | 400-550 | Pickaxe is exhausting |
| Sawing (hand saw) | 300-450 | Arms fatigue quickly |
| Notching/carving | 200-300 | Detailed work, less exertion |
| Walking in snow | 400-600 | Snowshoes reduce this by 30% |
| Sitting by fire (shelter) | 80-100 | Resting baseline |

**A builder needs 4,000-6,000 calories/day.** If eating only 2,000 (limited supplies + hunting), the calorie deficit is -2,000 to -4,000/day. At this rate, the body loses ~0.5-1 lb per day. After 30 days: 15-30 pounds lost. The "overly ambitious build" pattern from Alone TV: builders who construct impressive shelters but starve themselves in the process.

### Firewood Consumption

| Temperature | Firewood/day | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 32°F (0°C) | ~30 lbs | Mild, supplemental heating |
| 0°F (-18°C) | ~50-70 lbs | Standard winter |
| -20°F (-29°C) | ~80-100 lbs | Fire burns 18-20 hours/day |
| -40°F (-40°C) | ~120-150 lbs | Fire must burn 24/7 |
| -50°F+ | 150+ lbs | Survival mode — constant feeding |

**To prepare for winter:** You need at least 2-3 full cords of dry wood (a cord = 4×4×8 feet stacked). This is approximately 5,000-7,500 lbs of wood. Cutting, splitting, and stacking this takes 2-4 weeks of dedicated work.

### Water in Winter

- Streams freeze from the surface down. You must break through ice daily.
- Snow can be melted for water, but it's inefficient: 10 gallons of snow ≈ 1 gallon of water.
- You MUST boil/filter all water from natural sources (giardia, bacteria).
- A person needs 2-3 liters/day minimum. In cold + physical labor: 4-5 liters/day.
- Water containers freeze overnight. Keep them near the fire or inside sleeping bag.

## PART 7: THE ANIMALS ARE CHARACTERS

### How Animals Serve the Narrative

Animals are NOT just pets or dangers. They serve specific narrative functions:

| Function | Example | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **The silent witness** | A fox watches the character scream in grief | Wild — the fox watching Cheryl cry for her mother |
| **The danger sensor** | Dog growls/goes rigid before character notices the threat | Alone TV — dogs detecting bears |
| **The warmth** | Dog lies on character during hypothermia | Universal survival lore |
| **The companion** | Dog follows everywhere, reacts to builder's mood | Every episode |
| **The unexpected visitor** | A moose walks through the building site | Proenneke — animals marking the rhythm of the day |
| **The mirror** | Animal's behavior reflects builder's emotional state | Narrative technique |

### Dog Breeds That Fit the Show

| Breed | Best for setting | Personality for story |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Bernese Mountain Dog** | Alpine/European mountains | Gentle giant, protective, suffers in heat |
| **Husky** | Arctic/sub-Arctic | Energetic, independent, howls at storms |
| **Laika (Siberian)** | Siberia/Russia | Extremely cold-hardy, alert to wildlife |
| **German Shepherd** | Any cold setting | Loyal, obedient, protective |
| **Norwegian Elkhound** | Scandinavia | Bred for cold, bold, tracks animals |
| **Maremma Sheepdog** | Mountains/rural | Guardian, calm, large and warm |
| **Australian Shepherd** | North America/general | Intelligent, wants to work, needs a task |
| **Mixed breed / Rescue** | Anywhere | The "rescued dog rescues the builder" arc |

### Animals as Weather Indicators
- Birds going silent = predator nearby
- Dog refusing to go outside = storm coming
- Insects swarming at dusk = rain within hours
- Squirrels frantically caching = early winter coming
- Crows circling = something dead nearby (or a predator's kill)

## PART 8: WEATHER AS ANTAGONIST

### Specific Weather Events for Scripts

Don't write "it was cold" or "a storm came." Use these SPECIFIC weather events:

1. **Temperature inversion** — valley floor is 20-30° colder than the hilltop. The builder in the valley wakes up to -50°F while the ridge is -20°F. (Source: Wind River 1834)

2. **Ice storm (freezing rain)** — everything coated in 1-2 inches of ice. Branches snap. Power lines (if any) fall. Walking is impossible. Tools frozen shut. The most beautiful and deadly weather event. (Source: Walk in the Woods)

3. **Whiteout blizzard** — visibility drops to zero. Can't see the cabin from 10 feet away. Getting lost between the cabin and the woodpile is REAL. People have died 50 yards from their door.

4. **Wind chill** — at -20°F with 30 mph wind, exposed skin freezes in 10 minutes. The WIND is the killer, not the temperature. Finnmark, Norway: winds blow snow horizontally.

5. **Chinook/Föhn** — suddenly warm wind that melts everything fast. Snowpack collapses, flooding occurs, roads become mud. The "false spring" that melts your foundation's frost protection.

6. **The calm before** — the most beautiful day of winter. Clear skies, no wind, warm-ish. The builder relaxes. 6 hours later: the worst storm in a decade.

7. **Haboob/ground blizzard** — existing snow gets picked up by extreme winds and blown at ground level. The sky is clear but you can't see your feet.

8. **Thundersnow** — rare, terrifying. Thunder and lightning during a blizzard. Lightning can strike isolated structures (like a cabin).

## PART 9: QUICK REFERENCE — WHAT TO VALIDATE IN A SCRIPT

When reviewing or writing any construction script, check:

### ✅ Is the construction sequence correct?
- You can't frame a roof before walls are up
- You can't hang a door before walls are up
- You can't lay foundation on uncleared ground
- You can't stack walls without a level foundation

### ✅ Are the tools correct?
- Stakes are driven with a MALLET, not an axe
- Logs are debarked with a DRAWKNIFE, not a knife
- Frozen ground is broken with a PICKAXE, not a shovel
- Shingles are split with a FROE, not an axe

### ✅ Is the timeline realistic?
- A solo builder can't raise 8 courses of walls in 3 days
- Clearing 30m² of dense brush takes at MINIMUM 2 days
- A chimney takes 3-10 days, not an afternoon
- The character must REST (every 4-5 days minimum)

### ✅ Is the progress realistic?
- After 2 scenes of chopping: 5-10% cleared, NOT the whole site
- After 1 day of wall work: 1-2 courses, NOT the full wall
- Green logs shrink — gaps WILL appear
- The first chinking will fail. Plan for repair.

### ✅ Are the materials locally available?
- No cedar in Siberia
- No limestone in Finnish Lapland (granite instead)
- No bamboo in Alaska
- Birch bark is only harvestable in spring/summer

### ✅ Is the physical deterioration shown?
- Day 1 hands vs. Day 30 hands
- Weight loss visible by Week 2
- Sleep quality degrades with each week
- Injuries accumulate (cuts, strains, blisters → scars, calluses)

### ✅ Does the weather make sense for the location and season?
- Don't write -50°F for Scotland (minimum is about -17°F)
- Don't write blizzards in October for most European locations
- Daylight hours vary dramatically: 6 hours in December? 20 hours in June?
- The harshest cold is typically January-February (Northern Hemisphere)
