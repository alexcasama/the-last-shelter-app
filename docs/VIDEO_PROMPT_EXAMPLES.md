### SCENE 1 | BRIDGE AMBIENTAL | ~8s
**ELEMENTS:** —
**LOCATION:** yukon_aerial_establishing
**NARRATION:** none (ambient only — title overlay in post)

```
No music. A breathtaking ultra-wide aerial panorama reveals endless Yukon wilderness at dawn. The camera sweeps slowly over frozen ridges and dark boreal forest, gusts of snow swirling across the landscape. In the distance, a tiny helicopter crosses the valley, dwarfed by enormous snow-capped peaks. The camera holds wide, letting the immensity swallow everything.
SFX: Icy wind cutting across open terrain, distant bird calls, faint helicopter thud in the distance.
Diffused blue-gray daylight with subtle glimmers of ice reflection, majestic, slow, and hauntingly serene. 4K.
```

### SCENE 2 | PRESENTER | ~12s
**ELEMENTS:** @Jack
**LOCATION:** helicopter_interior_backseat
**NARRATION:** "In this first episode, we're heading into the wild Yukon wilderness. We're going to show you one of the most dangerous survival challenges you've ever seen."

```
No music. Medium shot from the backseat of a helicopter. Deafening rotor noise fills the cabin. @Jack sits by the window in the back row, aviation headset clamped over his ears, vibration shaking the frame. He turns to camera with sudden energy, raising his voice well above the rotor thunder. @Jack speaks loud over the noise: "In this first episode, we're heading into the wild Yukon wilderness!" Cut to wider angle across the backseat — @Jack still in headset, jabs his finger toward camera, headset cable swaying, projecting his voice at the same intensity. @Jack speaks loud: "We're going to show you one of the most dangerous survival challenges you've ever seen!" Cut to wide view through the helicopter side window — snowy rivers and boreal forest rushing past far below.
SFX: Deafening helicopter rotors, heavy wind battering fuselage, engine drone, voice projecting over mechanical noise.
Natural cold tones, harsh window light, raw documentary realism, handheld vibration. 4K.
```

### SCENE 3 | PRESENTER | ~8s
**ELEMENTS:** @Jack
**LOCATION:** helicopter_interior_backseat
**NARRATION:** "Two years ago, a war veteran named James Lindqvist died. But before he left, he made his son Erik one final promise: finish the cabin."

```
No music. Medium close-up of @Jack from the backseat, headset on, deafening rotors hammering. He points downward through the window, expression shifting from energy to gravity. Jaw tightens. @Jack raises his voice over the deafening rotors: "Two years ago, a war veteran named James Lindqvist died." Cut to tighter close-up — @Jack still in headset, hand dropping slowly. Eyes fixed forward, the weight of the words hitting his face. Still raising his voice over the noise but slowing his pace, deliberate, each word projected hard against the rotor thunder: "But before he left... he made his son Erik... one final promise." Pause. His eyes drop for a beat, then rise back to the lens. Still half-shouting over the engine, raw emotion pushing through the volume: "Finish. The cabin." He holds the look.
SFX: Deafening helicopter rotors, muffled wind battering glass, voice cutting through mechanical thunder at full volume.
Cold desaturated tones, harsh window light, intimate despite the chaos. 4K.
```

### SCENE 4 | FLASHBACK | ~5s
**ELEMENTS:** @James
**LOCATION:** yukon_forest_virgin
**NARRATION:** *(voice-over)* "Fifteen years ago, James came here seeking peace and escape."

```
No music. A lone figure (@James) walks through virgin boreal forest, heavy military pack on his back, axe strapped to the side. Dense spruce trees tower around him, untouched snow on the ground. He stops at a small natural clearing and looks around slowly, breathing visible in the cold air. His face carries exhaustion mixed with quiet determination. He drops his pack into the snow.
SFX: Boots crunching through deep undergrowth, distant river, wind through pine needles.
Warm amber tones, soft diffused lighting, visible film grain, nostalgic documentary feel. 4K.
```

---

### SCENE 5 | FLASHBACK | ~5s
**ELEMENTS:** @James
**LOCATION:** cabin_construction_past
**NARRATION:** *(voice-over)* "He wanted to build a place where he could leave behind the demons of war."

```
No music. @James swings an axe into a thick spruce log balanced on a rough sawhorse. Wood chips fly. Cut to his hands notching a log end with careful, practiced strikes. Cut to wider shot — three log walls rising from the ground, @James lifting a fresh log into position alone, straining, face determined. The clearing around him is raw — stumps, wood shavings, a small fire pit smoking nearby.
SFX: Axe striking green wood, heavy breathing, logs settling with deep creaks, fire crackling softly.
Warm amber tones, golden hour backlighting, vintage film grain. 4K.
```

---

### SCENE 6 | FLASHBACK | ~5s
**ELEMENTS:** @James
**LOCATION:** cabin_construction_past
**NARRATION:** *(voice-over)* "But a terrible illness took him before he could finish. He died knowing his dream was in ruins."

```
No music. @James sits on the ground, back against the half-built cabin wall. Three walls up, no roof. His axe lies abandoned beside him. Hands resting limp on his knees. He stares at the treeline with hollow, distant eyes. He doesn't move. Breath barely visible. Camera slow push-in on his face — weathered, gaunt, emptied. The unfinished cabin frames him like a monument to something that will never be completed.
SFX: Wind through exposed timber, a single crow call in the distance, deep silence underneath.
Warm tones fading to cold — amber draining to blue-gray, film grain heavy, slow oppressive atmosphere. 4K.
```

---

### SCENE 7 | BRIDGE AMBIENTAL | ~5s
**ELEMENTS:** —
**LOCATION:** cabin_ruins_aerial
**NARRATION:** *(SILENCIO TOTAL)*

```
No music. No voice. Aerial drone shot slowly descending toward a ruined cabin skeleton in a forest clearing. Rotted wooden posts and collapsed logs scattered on frozen ground, buried under a thick layer of fresh snow. Dense dark spruce forest surrounds the small clearing like a wall. The structure is completely destroyed — just bones of timber exposed to the sky. Camera descends in perfect silence, revealing the devastation inch by inch.
SFX: Only wind — low, constant, cold. Nothing else.
Cold blue-gray palette, overcast flat lighting, dense volumetric mist between trees, desolate stillness. 4K.
```

---

### SCENE 8 | PRESENTER | ~10s
**ELEMENTS:** @Jack
**LOCATION:** helicopter_interior_backseat
**NARRATION:** "Now Erik is here to face something absolutely insane. He has the skills, he has the experience. But what he doesn't have is time."

```
No music. Medium shot of @Jack in the backseat, headset on, deafening rotors hammering overhead. He straightens up, jaw forward, eyes sharp — energy shift. @Jack speaks loud with contained aggression, building over the rotor thunder: "Now Erik is here to face something absolutely insane!" Cut to tighter framing, camera pushing in slowly — @Jack still in headset, points at the lens, finger jabbing. @Jack speaks loud: "He has the skills, he has the experience!" Cut to close-up — @Jack still in headset, hand drops flat, palm down, a cutting gesture. Eyes drilling into the lens. Same intensity, projecting over the rotors. @Jack speaks loud: "But what he doesn't have... is time." He holds the beat. Jaw locked.
SFX: Deafening helicopter rotors, wind pressing against fuselage, voice projecting over mechanical roar.
Cold desaturated tones, dramatic handheld vibration, raw intensity. 4K.
```

### SCENE 9 | B-ROLL ANTICIPATORIO | ~5s
**ELEMENTS:** @Erik
**LOCATION:** building_site_snow
**NARRATION:** *(voice-over)* "ONLY 90 days before winter becomes a killing machine. Ninety days before temperatures drop to minus 40."

```
No music. Low tracking shot follows @Erik as he walks through a snow-covered clearing, surveying the terrain. Dense boreal forest of dark spruce surrounds him. He paces the perimeter with deliberate steps, looking up at the tree canopy, then down at the frozen ground. He stops, crouches, picks up a handful of frozen soil and lets it crumble. His breath clouds thick in the cold air. Wind pulls at his Carhartt jacket.
SFX: Snow crunching under boots, icy wind cutting low, fabric rustling in gusts.
Cold blue-gray palette, natural cold tones, documentary realism, diffused overcast light. 4K.
```

---

### SCENE 10 | B-ROLL ANTICIPATORIO | ~5s
**ELEMENTS:** —
**LOCATION:** yukon_mountains_storm
**NARRATION:** *(voice-over)* "Before blizzards bury everything under meters of snow."

```
No music. Epic wide landscape shot of Yukon mountains as a massive storm front rolls in from the north. Dark gray clouds swallow the peaks one by one. Snow blasts horizontally across the frame. Trees bend violently under wind. The camera holds steady as the wall of white advances toward the lens, swallowing visibility. One narrow beam of light breaks through before the storm consumes it.
SFX: Wind howling at full force, snow particles hissing against rock, distant thunder rumble, deep atmospheric pressure shift.
Cold blue-gray palette, dense volumetric fog, high-contrast dramatic realism. 4K.
```

---

### SCENE 11 | PRESENTER | ~10s
**ELEMENTS:** @Jack
**LOCATION:** helicopter_interior_backseat
**NARRATION:** "This won't be a game. Erik has to build a functional cabin from scratch. He has to light a fire that keeps him alive. And he has to survive alone in one of the most hostile environments on the planet."

```
No music. Medium close-up of @Jack in the backseat, headset on, maximum intensity. Deafening rotors shaking the cabin. He leans forward, elbows on knees, hands clasped, eyes locked to the lens. @Jack speaks loud: "This won't be a game!" Cut to same framing — @Jack still in headset, starts counting on his fingers, jabbing each one toward camera. @Jack speaks loud: "Erik has to build a functional cabin from scratch!" One finger. "He has to light a fire that keeps him alive!" Two fingers. Cut to slightly wider — @Jack still in headset, opens both hands, palms up, the weight of it. Projecting at the same intensity over the roar. @Jack speaks loud: "And he has to survive alone in one of the most hostile environments on the planet!" He drops his hands. Holds the lens. Perfect stillness against the chaos.
SFX: Deafening helicopter rotors, wind hammering fuselage, breathing audible between sentences, voice projecting over engine noise.
Cold desaturated tones, dramatic handheld vibration, raw documentary intensity. 4K.
```

### SCENE 12 | B-ROLL ANTICIPATORIO | ~5s
**ELEMENTS:** @Erik
**LOCATION:** building_site_edge
**NARRATION:** *(voice-over)* "Because if he fails, he's trapped. No shelter, no heat, no way out."

```
No music. Wide shot from behind — @Erik stands alone at the edge of the clearing, facing a dense wall of dark spruce forest. Axe in his right hand, hanging at his side. Snow falling lightly around him. He doesn't move. The forest towers over him. Camera holds the composition — one small figure against an enormous, indifferent wilderness. Wind pushes snow across the ground at his feet.
SFX: Low wind, snowflakes landing softly, distant creak of frozen timber, deep silence underneath everything.
Cold blue-gray palette, diffused flat overcast light, isolation emphasized, slow oppressive atmosphere. 4K.
```

---

### SCENE 13 | PRESENTER | ~10s
**ELEMENTS:** @Jack
**LOCATION:** landing_site
**NARRATION:** "Can he really do it? Can one man build from scratch what his father couldn't? Or will the Yukon destroy him?"

```
No music. Wide shot of helicopter touching down in a snowy clearing. Rotor wash blows snow and debris outward in a violent circle. Camera holds at ground level, snow particles rushing toward the lens. Cut to @Jack pushing open the door and stepping out — aggressive handheld backward tracking shot as he walks purposefully toward camera, boots crunching deep into snow. Ruined cabin visible through blowing snow behind him. @Jack speaks firmly, projecting over the winding-down rotors: "Can he really do it? Can one man build from scratch what his father couldn't?" Cut to wider — @Jack stops walking. Snow settling around him. @Jack speaks: "Or will the Yukon destroy him?" He holds the camera's gaze. Wind pulls at his jacket.
SFX: Rotor blades winding down, boots crunching in deep snow, wind gusting, snow particles hissing.
Cold blue-gray palette, ground-level documentary realism. 4K.
```

---

### SCENE 14 | PRESENTER | ~8s
**ELEMENTS:** @Jack
**LOCATION:** cabin_ruins_ground
**NARRATION:** "This is about to begin. This is The Last Shelter."

```
No music. Medium shot of @Jack standing in the clearing. Destroyed cabin ruins behind him — collapsed logs, rotted posts buried in snow. Cold mist hangs in the air. He looks directly at camera. Perfect stillness. Epic pause — three full seconds of silence. Breath visible in the freezing air. @Jack speaks with quiet conviction: "This is about to begin." Beat. Camera slow push-in tightening on his face. @Jack speaks: "This is The Last Shelter." He holds the lens. No movement. Cut to extreme wide shot pulling back slowly — revealing @Jack standing alone against the vast, hostile wilderness. One man. Infinite white. Hold for two seconds.
SFX: Cold wind, absolute silence between words, then low wind building on the wide pullback.
Cold blue-gray palette, dense volumetric mist, high-contrast gothic realism, epic and final. 4K.
```

## Image Generation Prompts

### helicopter_interior_backseat
```
Real photography, Canon EOS R5. Interior of a helicopter backseat, POV from someone sitting in the back row facing slightly toward the side window. Worn leather seats, aviation headset hanging nearby, instrument panel partially visible ahead. Through the large side window, vast snowy Yukon wilderness visible far below — dark boreal forest, frozen rivers, snow-capped mountains on the horizon. Cold blue-gray daylight filling the cabin. Subtle vibration. NO people in the frame, empty seat. 16:9 landscape format. Photorealistic, NOT CGI, NOT 3D render.
