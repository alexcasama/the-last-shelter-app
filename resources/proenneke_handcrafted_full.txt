I wish to dedicate this book to my wife and 
soulmate, Kathryn Schubeck. We first met at Dick’s 
cabin in 2000, fell in love the following year, married 
and were steadfast partners and caretakers of Dick 
Proenneke’s legacy for 19 summers.
I wish also to dedicate this book to the visitors 
who told us that visiting Dick’s cabin was not on their 
bucket list, it was their bucket list, and to those so filled 
with emotion at finally arriving at Dick’s cabin, they 
wept. And to the wife whose husband was so affected 
touching Dick’s handcrafted door he could barely talk. 
She had planned the trip as a wedding anniversary 
present, paying for it by cleaning extra houses, which 
was her vocation.

Occasionally, but rarely, the right person comes along 
at exactly the right time. That’s what happened in 2000 
when Monroe Robinson arrived at Twin Lakes in 
Alaska’s Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. The 
National Park Service had requested Monroe’s assis-
tance in restoring and caring for Dick Proenneke’s log 
structures and handcrafted artifacts. The year before, 
at age 82, Dick left his log cabin on Upper Twin Lake 
and moved permanently to California to live with 
his brother. Without a fire burning in his woodstove, 
moisture began to accumulate in the interior of the 
cabin and it began to slowly deteriorate. If that weren’t 
bad enough, the neighborhood bears wasted no time 
in doing what Dick had kept them from doing for 
decades, breaking in. 
Becoming the caretaker for Dick’s cabin and 
possessions was a tall order, perhaps one that only 
Monroe Robinson could fill.  As a craftsman, Dick 
had one standard – perfection. His cabin, cache, 
woodshed, furniture and tools bear witness to his 
ingenuity, resourcefulness and skills. If he needed 
something, he built it. If something broke, he fixed it. 
For 30 years he kept everything shipshape, from the 
gravel on the floor of his cabin to the moss on the roof 
of his cache. And woe to any porcupine that dropped 
in to nibble on a cabin log or a table leg. As Monroe 
went about his repairs and restorations, he too had a 
standard – Dick’s. 
Monroe soon discovered that restoring and rep-
licating Dick’s artifacts opened a window into Dick’s 
Foreword  
life. He worked on-site near the Proenneke cabin, 
used many of the same raw materials – spruce trees, 
discarded tin fuel containers and salvaged aircraft 
parts – and on occasion, even used Dick’s tools. This 
close connection gave Monroe insight into not only 
the mechanics of how a chair or shovel was con-
structed, but the thought process that Dick followed 
while constructing it.  Details on how Dick created 
many objects, from tin trays with scalloped edges to 
a bean can chimney cap, might have forever remained 
a mystery had not Monroe discovered the tool(s) he 
used to craft them in a dark corner of Dick’s cabin or 
woodshed. And more often than not, the tools them-
selves were handmade.
“The Handcrafted Life of Dick Proenneke”   
reveals elements of Dick’s life at Twin Lakes untold 
by his journals and films. It provides us with greater 
understanding and appreciation of his creativity, 
determination and self-sufficiency.  Monroe’s timely 
restoration of Dick’s cabin and his replication of Dick’s 
creations, snow shovel to saw horse, are an enduring 
gift to us all.

 xi
Dick Proenneke’s cabin in Alaska’s remote wilderness 
has become a pilgrimage for hundreds of people each 
year. For 19 summers I witnessed these pilgrimages as 
caretaker of his cabin. Through my work restoring the 
cabin and replicating items Dick made, I discovered 
how one man found overwhelming fulfillment and joy 
in making, using and repairing what he needed with 
simple tools and available materials. I feel a respon-
sibility to share what I learned about this remarkable 
man and his life at Twin Lakes.
In the late 1970s I built a log bridge in Alaska, 
across Miller Creek. Turns out, that queen-post 
trussed log bridge was also my bridge to Dick. But 
how I came to build that bridge, both literally and fig-
uratively, requires leaving Alaska and traveling back 
in time to a starkly different place: a rural desert town 
in southeastern Arizona in the mid-1940s – my child-
hood home.
From Arizona to Alaska
My parents both grew up poor on desert farms 
in Arizona. My mother was a homemaker and gar-
dener. She sold eggs, milk, cream and home-churned 
butter. My father was a talented mechanic. He also 
drove a propane truck, delivered fertilizer and pesti-
cides to farms, and worked at a grain silo. He could 
make almost anything from steel or wood. Our home, 
until I was 12, was a WWII barrack my dad moved 
70 miles from a military base and remodeled into a 
small home.
I was always making things. My father told me, 
years later, he lost many tools from my not putting 
them back where I’d found them but he didn’t want 
to stop me from making things. I also loved wild ani-
mals. I came from a hunting family and we ate wild 
pig, deer, rabbits, quail and doves. When I was 11 
Introduction
I took the Northwest School of Taxidermy lessons. 
Growing up I kept dozens of birds, a family of skunks, 
a rattlesnake, a marmot, a ringtail cat and two coatis 
as pets.
In 1958, my father began working for the National 
Park Service as the maintenance man at Chiricahua 
National Monument. This was a pivotal point in 
my life. I was exposed to the Civilian Conservation 
Corps’ craft and conversations about wildlife and wild 
places. In the 7th and 8th grades I attended a sin-
gle-room school just outside of Chiricahua. I remem-
ber unrolling an outdated pull-down map to see where 
the great herds of caribou lived in the far north. I read 
names like Mackenzie River, Yukon River and Great 
Slave Lake surrounded with a blank landscape labeled 
“Unchartered.” I wanted to go there.
I also wanted to attend college, just like my only 
relative to do so – an older cousin who my family kept 
on a golden pedestal. Despite a high school fight that 
left him totally blind, he became an attorney and later, a 
doctor of psychology. He water skied, and won awards 
for wrestling and running. I wanted to be like him.
At age 11, I lost sight in one eye. Turns out I had 
the same genetic predisposition as my cousin. I was 
warned to never do anything that jarred my head, 
but I was a rough-and-tumble kid living in a rough-
and-tumble community. I ran track in high school, 
climbed rock and ice cliffs, raced bicycles and moun-
tain climbed in college. Advances in medicine from 
my cousin’s generation have maintained my good 
vision with the help of eight surgeries.
I enrolled at Colorado State University, but didn’t 
have enough money to complete my first year. I was 
captivated by an evening slide show about summer 
jobs in Alaska. I needed a job, but it was Alaska’s wil-
derness and wildlife that held my attention. I changed

Introduction
my major from electrical engineering to fisheries biol-
ogy to make my application for a job counting salmon 
for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game more 
desirable.
In the spring of 1965, at 19, I flew to Alaska to 
count sockeye salmon on the Kvichak River. That 
year I witnessed the largest run of wild salmon ever 
recorded, with more than 23 million swimming 
upriver to spawn after 24 million were caught in the 
commercial fishery. For the next six years I paid for 
college by returning to Alaska to work for half the 
year. Little did I know that I was counting salmon 
just south of Twin Lakes where Dick began building 
his cabin in 1968.
Work and Adventure
During my third summer in Alaska, Jay 
Hammond, the bush pilot who, two years earlier, flew 
me to the Kvichak River, came to the Alaska Fish and 
Game office and asked which of the 50 young men 
counting fish they would recommend to do some hard 
“grunt” work. The biologist suggested me.
Jay wanted to construct a 12' by 16' cabin on the 
Kejulik River, known for the enormous brown bears 
that thrive on the abundant salmon that migrate 
there every summer to spawn. Jay flew me in his sin-
gle-engine float plane for an hour over a tundra land-
scape devoid of human life. He pointed out building 
materials stacked on the shore of Becharof Lake. A 
commercial fishing boat had transported the mate-
rial up the Egegik River from a fishing village. The 
materials had been unloaded on the shore, several 
miles from where the Kejulik River drained into 
Becharof Lake.
We landed on a small tundra pond half a mile 
from the narrow winding river. After my legs buckled 
from the weight, Jay carried the 40hp outboard motor 
with a jet lower unit to mount on a flat-bottomed river-
boat he had previously flown in. Jay left, telling me he 
would return in a few days. He hoped the wind would 
allow me to boat the building material across the end 
of Becharof Lake to his cabin site on the Kejulik River. 
He left me with his 30-06 for bear protection, a few 
hand tools, and the boat and motor. 
I remember ceaseless rain and wind, and 
brown-bear prints in the rutted trail along the river. 
The only structure for 50 miles was a collapsing cabin 
next to where Jay wanted his cabin built. Several reels 
of soaked 16mm movie film in the rotting cabin was 
all that remained from when a filmmaker was shot 
by his girlfriend a generation earlier. That imagery, 
alongside my fear of unseen bears, stayed with me.
Lying in my sleeping bag, wet in my rain-soaked 
tent that first night, I knew I would not sleep. To stop 
my racing mind I headed downriver. I felt wild and 
free racing across the waves of Becharof. The weather 
that night was not the calm wind Jay had suggested 
I wait for. Waves crashed in as I loaded lumber and 
plywood. A flat-bottomed boat is not safe on rough 
water. Back on Becharof my wild-and-free feeling 
turned to terror as I steered to avoid the largest of the 
breaking waves. My first load up the river went with-
out a hitch but on subsequent trips I had to pull the 
boat up the river because of darkness. Brush along the 
shore forced me to pull the boat while wading against 
the current – sometimes stepping into a channel over 
my hip boots and having to grab the boat to keep 
from swimming.
By morning I had the materials hauled to the 
cabin site. Jay left me a single piece of paper with 
sketches of the cabin just in case I had time to start 
construction. Still too unsettled to sleep, I started to 
work. I learned about building a structure square in 
order to nail edges of plywood along the floor joists 
and I learned that cutting wet plywood with a hand-
saw was worse than frustrating. The sketch included 
the cabin size, and the location of the door and two 
windows. There were details of studs cut short to hold 
up a header over the windows and door; the overlap-
ping top plates at the corners of the walls; and a cable 
that was to run from each corner of the cabin to a 
deadman buried in the tundra to keep the cabin from 
blowing away.
When Jay arrived days later he was surprised to 
see I had the four deadman holes dug, the floor built 
and three walls standing. I had buried a log in each 
deadman hole with steel cable wrapped around it to 
anchor the cabin against the gale force winds that 
blow down the Kejulik. With classic Jay Hammond 
humor he turned a piece of his wife’s blueberry pie 
 xiii
Introduction
(intended as a thank you) into an inquiry if I would 
stay and finish the cabin. He left me the emergency 
food rations from his plane before flying away.
I worked for Jay and his wife, Bella, at their home 
in Naknek and at their Lake Clark homestead for a 
few weeks each of the next few summers. I felt a part 
of their family, confident and appreciated as a person 
and for the work I did. Conversations about politics, 
people, wildlife and wilderness were an education far 
beyond my upbringing.
A Bridge to Dick
Although I graduated from college in 1970 with 
a degree in fisheries biology, I moved to Alaska and 
spent the winter as caretaker of Jay and Bella’s Lake 
Clark log home. For the next 12 years I helped build 
houses in Homer, Palmer, Moose Pass, Chugiak and 
Anchorage, living in three of the homes for a few years 
each. I built custom staircases, cabinets and decks. In 
the winter I built furniture and tried to teach myself 
how to more effectively use hand tools.
In 1970 Jay suggested I build a log bridge across 
Miller Creek at their home on Lake Clark. Not con-
fident, I turned him down. Seven years later I visited 
Jay in Juneau, at his office as Governor of Alaska. 
From the attaché case on the top of his desk he pulled 
out a sketch of a queen-post trussed log bridge. “It’s 
yours,” he said, handing it to me. 
The bridge needed to support the weight of his 
front-end loader and he wanted as little steel visible 
as possible. Knowing I was over my head I asked a 
truss engineer for help. He suggested large metal 
plates bolted over every joint, which was not what Jay 
wanted. Then I remembered Lee Cole, a log builder 
from Homer, considered the best in Alaska. In 1978 I 
heard Lee was building a log home on the mountain-
side overlooking Anchorage. I thought if I could hang 
around that job I could learn how to fit one irregular 
log surface to another. I drove to the job site propos-
ing to build the entry door for the home as a way of 
introduction. Lee already had plans for the door but I 
was hired to complete the house beyond the log walls 
which, except for the entry door, was the extent of 
Lee’s involvement. 
I was hired to start work a month before Lee 
completed the log work. Lee spent an hour each day 
instructing me how every aspect of my finishing the 
house should integrate with his log work and accom-
modate 4" of settling as the logs shrank – including an 
open staircase. Lee also spent a second hour each day 
teaching me the craft of log work. 
When I told Lee about the Hammonds’ log 
bridge, he enthusiastically helped me visualize the 
construction. He suggested how I might drill a hole 
lengthwise through a 4' length of log so the structural, 
threaded-steel rods could be hidden and exit from the 
center of each end of the logs. With Lee’s help, I felt 
like I had completely built the bridge in my head.

Introduction
Lake Clark homestead caretaker, helped me fell the 
spruce trees and raft them to Miller Creek. I started 
the stone work in the early spring when Miller creek 
was at its lowest flow. 
Lee told me building a trussed log bridge would be 
more challenging than building a log house. Building 
a log house involves scribing and fitting one log at a 
time to fit the log structure already in place. The fit 
can always be scribed again to make a tighter fit. Once 
the builder’s content, the log is fastened in place. 
A trussed log bridge is less forgiving. I had to 
scribe the end of one log to conform to the surface 
of one or two other logs. I set up the logs on shore 
because there was never a partially constructed truss. 
I scribed and fit the end of each log independently 
of the opposite end of that log. The initial scribe and 
fit was the final fit. Any change of angle, rotation or 
length to help tighten the fit at one end of the log neg-
atively affected the fit on the opposite end. And then 
there were all of the hidden mortise-and-tenon joints 
inside the scribed fit and the heavy threaded-steel rods 
hidden inside the logs.
It was a day of reckoning for the queen-post truss 
on each side of the bridge when all the logs were put 
in place the first and only time. There was no refitting. 
I constructed the bridge with no steel visible and every 
joint credit-card tight. I felt on top of my game. The 
Hammonds’ log bridge is my finest endeavor.
On March 9, 1981, Dick wrote in his journal, “I 
managed to keep pretty busy doing what some folks 
might call very unimportant things.” He was respond-
ing to a letter from Governor Jay Hammond asking 
him to work on an upstream creek stabilization proj-
ect on his Lake Clark homestead to protect his log

Introduction
home and the trussed log bridge from being washed 
away in a flood like the one that occurred in 1971. 
Dick had an idea of how to control Miller Creek and 
hiked the 25 miles to Lake Clark to help. In that same 
journal entry Dick commented on the bridge: “It is 
the most beautiful piece of log work I have ever seen 
done by that cabinet maker Monroe, his (Governor 
Hammond’s) friend in Anchorage.” 
A few years later there was another flood. Dick’s 
upstream bank stabilization kept erosion to a mini-
mum. When the water level reached the log bridge, 
the bridge floated free as I designed it to do. Jay 
retrieved it by boat and levered it back onto the rock 
foundation.
A Hike to Meet Dick
In 1981, while working for the Hammonds at 
Lake Clark, Jay told me Dick thought highly of the 
bridge and would like to meet me. Jay also said when 
Dick was ready to go home after helping Jay with his 
flood-control measures, Jay offered to fly him. Dick 
thanked him but said he walked to Jay’s and he’d walk 
home. So when Jay offered to fly me to Twin Lakes, I 
declined. As eager as I was to meet Dick, I wanted to 
meet him by hiking to Twin Lakes. 
The following summer I, along with John Branson, 
hiked 30 miles from Telequana Lake to Twin Lakes 
to visit Dick, then on to Lake Clark.
“June 6, 1982: Over cast, Calm & 40:
I looked up to see ... John Branson and 
another backpacker come into view. It had to 
be Monroe the expert cabinet maker and jack 
of all trades who is working for Jay at Miller 
Creek. The boy that built the nicest bridge 
of logs I have ever seen. They looked pretty 
sorry as it had been raining since morning. 
“Where have you guys been” I greeted them. 
May 20th had been scheduled as the day 
they would start from Telaquana Lake. John 
says “Glen [Alsworth] took us over June 3rd.” 
Five or six other hikers wanted to hike the 
route but had chickened out and wouldn’t be 
sorry after they heard of hiking conditions in 
early June of 1982.”
 They got out from under their packs and 
came in ... I asked them how the hike had 
gone till now. Not so good. Deep wet snow 
on the high table land between Telaquana 
and Turquoise. Up to your pockets and some 
places lots of slush under it. About seven 
miles of real tough going. No caribou at 
Turquoise where Will (Troyer) and I had 
seen thousands last year. And the wind blew 
fierce and it rained. They had reached the 
lower end of lower twin the afternoon of the 
second day. They ran a porkypine out of the 
old Frank Bell cabin in the bend of the Chili 
River and moved in ... The hikers had to pitch 
their tent inside because of the leaking roof. 
Stayed a day there while it rained and blew. 
Came on up to my cabin in about five hours. 
It came evening and we trudged the 
beach to Spike’s cabin. They would appreci-
ate it after being rained on and wind blown 
for a couple days. I uncovered the windows. 
Monroe put up the stove pipe above the roof. 
I left them and came down to have a 
light supper for myself. Monroe came down 
later to stay until near 10 o’clock. John was 
a little tired, he said. Monroe is interesting. 
Been many places in Alaska and western 
U.S. and did many things. Now, he has his 
own cabinet making business in town and 
has been working for Jay several summers. 
He told me that the fancy log bridge that 
he built across Miller Creek took about 12 
weeks to build counting from the start of the 
project ... (including the stone foundation) 
Time to turn in and he trudged the beach 
to the point. I called it a day for I would be 
getting up early to see them off.” 
I was captivated by Dick’s stories. He told me he 
built his cabin with the intention that it rot back into 
the earth once he was gone. I wondered why he would 
construct a rock fireplace if that was his intent and 
was sad that he wished his cabin to rot. When Dick 
accompanied us on our hike to Low Pass the next day, 
he stopped several times to inspect interesting things

Introduction
despite my having been told he normally hiked with-
out stopping. He was even more complex and inter-
esting than I had imagined. At the time I had no idea 
how immersed in his life and work I would become.
From Alaska to California
 In 1983, I heard Jim Krenov was teaching wood-
working at the College of the Redwoods in Fort Bragg, 
California. I had read each of his books multiple times 
and longed for a higher level of craftsmanship while 
working with hand tools. I applied and worked with 
Jim during the program’s third and fourth years. It 
was the pinnacle of my formal training.  
Living on the Northern California coast those 
two years made me realize how much I missed a long 
growing season. Also, the sight of ancient redwood 
stumps along the roads permeated my consciousness. 
I couldn’t stop thinking about the loss of old-growth 
forest or the still-sound wood that could be salvaged. 
After attending Krenov’s school I returned to Alaska, 
sold my house and set up a woodworking shop in a 
carport on the Mendocino coast. It was difficult to 
find property for gardening when tall, second-growth 
redwood trees shaded almost every acre. I fell in love 
with property that had an apple orchard and open 
land. The house, however, I could barely tolerate. 
Three times Jim tried to sell me four machines he 
brought from Sweden. I could not convince him to 
keep them. In 1986, using those machines and ebony 
from the Celebes Islands, I built a 56"-diameter din-
ing table with eight 13" leaves, 18 chairs and a 9' side 
table that I cantilevered from my client’s adobe wall. 
As I started the commission, I sent Dick photographs 
of a rosewood china hutch and matching dining table 
I completed while at Krenov’s school.
“Monroe those pictures are good,” Dick wrote. 
“Maybe a polarizer would have knocked some reflec-
tion a bit. I try to imagine the time required to build 
fine furniture as you do it. Sometimes I feel that I 
have patience but now I doubt that I know what the 
word means. That China cabinet is a beautiful exam-
ple of fine work and to think it was built by a bridge 
builder, but the best bridge builder I have ever seen. 
Those logs fit, (period), and they still do. That table 
top is beautiful and the grain pattern is so uniform in 
the leaves. It takes some savvy to make that work out. 
The only way I can see that you could accomplish that 
would be to rip a curved stick and not just one but 
many. Something about your trade that I don’t savvy. 
At home in Iowa our house had some finish done by 
artificial graining. I think my father did it too for he

was a painter. I know he had the tools to do it with. 
Stain was used (applied) with those tools. I doubt very 
much there is any artificial decorating of your fine fur-
niture grain wise. Those 16 chairs, the buffet and table 
with eight leaves will keep you busy for quite a while. I 
could walk to Ft. Bragg to see it finished … That man 
Jim Krenov must be a good man with tools and a man 
who treasures tools.”
During this time I taught workshops and wrote 
some articles for Fine Woodworking magazine. My 
child, Elan (they/them), was born at home in 1988. On 
the afternoon of their birth, while singing a made-up 
love song, I carried them on a short walk through the 
redwood forest just beyond the back door of my house. 
I stayed home with Elan until they started school, 
gardening and working on the house. Nothing in my 
life has been as monumental as so closely sharing that 
time in Elan’s life. Our closeness today springs from 
those years together. They have retained a lifelong love 
of nature from our early walks in the redwood forest, 
and from later summers at Twin Lakes.
In 1992, I purchased a portable sawmill. Roger 
Moore and I bought an old flatbed truck with a

20,000-pound winch behind the cab. Between 1992 
and 1999, the two of us salvaged left-behind redwood 
logs from the forest and planted hundreds of seed-
lings. I also advocated, with a measure of success, for 
stopping the harvesting of old-growth redwoods still 
remaining and for requiring greater stream-side pro-
tection during future logging operations. I am as pas-
sionate about issues affecting the forest and wildlife as 
I am about making new things with wood. I believe 
the redwood forest will provide our community with 
recreation, quality wood and an abundance of fish for-
ever if we become good stewards. 
Working in the forest was hard, dirty and danger-
ous. The largest log we loaded, using only the winch, 
was 81/2' in diameter, 11' long and weighed a little 
more than 17,000 pounds.
Today, selling ancient redwood lumber and 
slabs up to 4' wide remains a part of my livelihood. 
My shop has a collection of old Davis and Wells 
machines, which I rebuilt after two trips scouring 
the Los Angeles basin. The machines I bought from 
Jim Krenov I sold to Robert Van Norman in Robert’s 
Creek, British Columbia, in 2014. Jim’s machines are 
in reverent hands.
An Invitation to Restore
Dick departed Twin Lakes in 1999, leaving the 
vast majority of his tools and handcrafted objects at 
his cabin. In 2000, the National Park Service asked 
if I would come to Alaska to consult on the resto-
ration of Dick’s cabin. I first met with Steve Peterson, 
the National Park Service’s head historical architect 
in Alaska. Steve had visited Dick’s cabin and we dis-
cussed ideas. He left final decisions for me to make 
once I was on site. 
When I arrived at Twin Lakes I could feel Dick’s 
presence in everything I touched. I knew Dick’s 
cabin, cache and woodshed, and hundreds of hand-
crafted items, along with his journals, film and slides, 
presented an opportunity for future generations to 
glimpse this inspiring and extraordinary life with a 
clarity rarely offered. Dick’s original furnishings were 
where he left them. The evidence of his crafting and 
repairing was everywhere.
Restoring and caring for Dick’s structures and 
xviii 
	
Introduction
handcrafted artifacts became my full-time commitment 
that summer, and for the next 18 summers. With the 
help of John Branson I restored the roof of Dick’s cabin 
and woodshed in 2000. In 2003, I replaced the rotted 
bottom logs of the cabin and woodshed, and replaced 
the legs and restored the roof of his cache. As Dick’s 
handcrafted artifacts became too old to be outside or 
were deemed too precious to leave at his cabin, I made 
replicas and restored the originals as needed before 
sending them to the National Park Service archives in 
Anchorage. I used hand tools as had Dick. I focused on 
replicating his technique, the way he mended things, 
and gave each item the patina of Dick’s use. The respon-
sibilities of keeping this remote historic site true to how 
it was when Dick lived were numerous and always 
changing. In the later years I assisted K. giving tours, 
especially for visitors interested in Dick’s handcraft.
Spending so much time as caretaker of Dick’s 
cabin, while caring about the cabin’s longevity, gave me 
a unique perspective. I observed what did and did not 
work to discourage porcupines from gnawing on the 
hinges of Dick’s Dutch door and around the perim-
eter of his cabin; what kept Freddy the squirrel, voles 
and shrews from taking up residence inside; and what 
discouraged black bears from trying to enter. I judged 
the rate of rot on Dick’s exposed spruce during the time 
he lived at Twin Lakes and how fast my restorations 
started to fail, along with actions that would slow or 
stop the decay. Arriving each spring I would remove 
trees that had blown down. Eventually I understood 
how the erosion of Dick’s rock jetties allowed the 
fierce early winter wind-driven waves to move gravel 
and sand away from the beach Dick maintained to be 
serviceable for airplanes. Early on, my supervisors and 
other park staff both sought my expertise and contrib-
uted their expert opinions. Dick’s cabin remained well 
cared for with this level of cooperative attention.	
Hope, Spike and Weisser’s cabins, just a short walk 
up the shore from Dick’s cabin, were an integral part 
of Dick’s life at Twin Lakes. Dick sometimes stayed 
in Spike’s cabin to allow a female visitor to stay in his 
and it was used as a guest cabin. Dick stored things in 
all three cabins, including his canoe, outboard motor, 
sled, skies, extra food and hundreds of other small 
items. I replaced the roof and bottom logs of these 
three cabins in 2001. John Branson played a major role 
in these restorations, with some assistance from Rick 
Phillips on the roof of Weisser’s cabin.

Introduction
In 2000, K. Schubeck was asked by the National 
Park Service to watch over Dick’s cabin for the sum-
mer and be a tour guide when visitors arrived. She had 
spent the previous three summers inventorying plants 
for the Lake Clark National Park. She spent a mem-
orable day with Dick in 1997, and watched over his 
cabin for two weeks in 1999 when he was away. Elan, 
who was 11 years old at the time, was with me at Twin 
Lakes in 2000, living in Hope’s cabin. K. likes to say 
she fell in love with Elan that first summer. 
K. retired from teaching in 2001, and after her sec-
ond summer as tour guide at Dick’s cabin she visited 
Elan and me in California. When we married after 
our third summer at Twin Lakes I made a vow to keep 
returning to Twin Lakes as long as K. wished. Spike’s 
cabin was our home. Visitors often sat in Spike’s cabin 
as we discussed Dick’s life and the value of keeping 
wilderness unimpaired for future generations. Where 
better to have these conversations than in the heart 
of wilderness with the contradiction of Dick’s cabin 
being in that wilderness. 
Arriving at Twin Lakes in 2000, I felt a gravity 
for keeping Dick present. For every handcrafted item 
I knew what Dick used it for there was at least one I 
could not identify. Frequently, visitors contributed to 
my understanding of Dick’s handcrafted life. So I see 
this book as a collaboration connecting Dick to myself 
and many visitors. I felt a responsibility to write this 
book because never again will someone touch Dick’s 
original work as I have.
When I returned home from Twin Lakes in 2018 
I realized I had been caring for Dick’s home for 19 
years; it was time to take care of my own home. I am 
building furniture and remodeling the house to show-
case the local woods of the Mendocino coast. K. and I 
continue to work in our garden and orchard, creating 
community events such as an annual apple juicing day.
Stewardship of the land I live on, the forest I work 
in and the wild places I visit has long been part of 
my life. Lee Cole never wanted to be famous for his 
skill, rather he simply wanted to leave a legacy of log 
craftsmanship. Jay Hammond did not have a desire 
for national politics but he cared deeply for the future 
of Alaska and the people who live there. Jim Krenov 
left a legacy of inspiration and sensitivity about wood 
to an entire generation of fine woodworkers. Dick 
Proenneke modeled a life close to nature by limiting 
his impact on the wilderness around him. These men-
tors have inspired my journey.
Many visitors told K. and me they desired a life 
similar to Dick’s life. At Twin Lakes, I found mean-
ing not from doing my best work but by replicating 
Dick’s handcraft to the finest level of detail I could. 
Sometimes I would return to Spike’s cabin and say to 
K., “I got to know Dick a little better today.” Recently 
I have repeated those same words to her after deci-
phering Dick’s almost impossible handwriting from 
his final letters to me. And there are now times, late 
in the day, when I smile. For I have finished a project 
with supplies at hand. I have made it work and I have 
not been too hurried along the way. It’s possible to live 
a life similar to Dick’s without living in Alaska. For 
me, Dick never feels far away.

Here are a few comments to help you understand the 
structure of this book.
Every chapter uses edited selections taken from 
Dick Proenneke’s journals. Interspersed within each 
chapter are my italicized comments. Chapters 1, 2, 3, 
4, 7 and 8 are written chronologically. Chapters 5, 6 
and 9 are subdivided into several subjects within the 
chapters and each subject is explored chronologically.
In 1982, Dick told me he was displeased that Sam 
Keith added his own words while writing “One Man’s 
Wilderness” rather than using Dick’s exact words. 
Dick expressed to others that he hoped any future use 
of his journals be kept as he wrote them. With that in 
mind I entered this project with trepidation. I made 
a few editorial decisions regarding the use of Dick’s 
journals and I hope Dick would approve. Dick’s jour-
nals did not include the “year” with each date. Rather, 
the year was delineated at the start of each hand-writ-
ten journal. To make it easier to follow the chronology 
of the story within each chapter I have added the year 
to each date as if it were Dick’s writing. 
Dick made comments about the weather includ-
ing the temperature, wind and other conditions 
immediately after the date of each entry. I included 
Dick’s weather observations within Chapter 2, and 
only occasionally in other chapters.
There are a variety of words that Dick misspelled 
throughout his journals. I have corrected these mis-
spellings throughout my editing without noting my 
changes. These words include: “knoll” for “knowl,” 
“maybe” for “maby,” “before” for “befor,” “Kijik” for 
“Kigik,” “noisy” for “noisey” and “dessert” for “desert.”
Explanation to the Reader  
When I thought Dick misspelled words with 
intent, I left them as he spelled them including but 
not limited to: “porkypine” for “porcupine,” “purtiest” 
for “prettiest,” “touristas” for “tourist” and “purty” for 
“pretty.”
Dick had his own colorful way of naming tools 
and other things such as: “hurdy gurdy drill” for egg-
beater drill, “corrugater” to refer to his handcrafted 
sheet-metal edge-crimping tool, “diggins” to refer 
to his cabin, “cuttingest machine” for a tool that was 
performing well for its intended job, “old residenter 
teakettle,” “monkey wrenchen” and many more. I left 
all of these exactly as Dick wrote them. 
Dick’s journals, once transcribed, amount to 
more than 7,000 pages. To tell the story of Dick’s life 
through his tools and handcraft in his own words, 
I had to be very selective in what to include. I did 
not use Dick’s daily journal entries in their entirety. 
I sometimes included a single sentence from a day’s 
journal entry. I did not want every use of Dick’s jour-
nal entries to be filled with ellipses. I used them only 
when portions of a sentence were omitted or when a 
sentence in the middle of a paragraph was omitted. 
I did not use ellipses when I edited out the first sen-
tence or multiple sentences at the beginning or end of 
a paragraph. I also did not use ellipses when I edited 
out an entire paragraph. 
These editorial changes make the reading of Dick’s 
journals convey the subject as concisely as possible. 
Nowhere did I change the meaning of Dick’s words.

Chapter 1
July 12, 1967: 
Since I came to the lakes … I have been on the look out for a good 
site to build a cabin. There are very few choice sites to choose from. 
Either no sand beach, no protection from the wind, no wood nearby, no 
view etc. I think the other side (north side) would be better in late fall, 
winter and early spring. Less wind and more sun. The south side better 
in late spring, summer and early fall. The sun at your back more protec-
tion from the sun and more blueberries and caribou. If I could afford 
to work for Marshall Farmer [Marshall Farmer is the owner of the hunting 
cabin that Fred Cowgill constructed just down country from the Proenneke 
cabin site.] I could afford to work for myself. Clear the best site I know 
of and see how it looks. Herb Wright had staked a recreation site down 
this side of Hope Creek but Twin Lakes is not open for recreation sites 
anymore but I could stake it for a home site (5 acres) build a cabin, live 
on the land five months and buy it for two dollars and fifty cents per 
acre. The site has a good beach, protection for a plane both winter and 
summer. Protection from the very strong winds that come down from 
the high mountains in winter. Good water and plenty wood. A real good 
view down the lake and both sides including the waterfall.
I took shovel and axe and corn knife and paddled down to the site. 
Knocked some low branches off of a few trees to see what the view 
would be like. One thing led to another, cut and burn some buck brush 
and willows. Clear out a rotted log and stump, grub some willow roots. 
The weather was looking like rain. Getting dark in the south. And 
soon it started to thunder. The second afternoon in seventeen years (in 
Alaska) that I have heard it thunder. Then it started to rain and I hap-
pened to think I had laundry and my sleeping bag on the clothesline. I 
made a mad dash up the beach and water was running off of my hat in 
no time but it stopped raining before I got to the cabin. [Hope and Spike 
Carrithers’ cabin that we now call Spike’s cabin.] I put them inside and went 
back. A tree stood where the cabin should be so I dug around the roots, 
chopped them off and pushed it over, limbed it and it is ready to saw 
into lengths I can handle. Thunder and light showers continued and now 
at seven it is still thundering.
Corn knife. Dick called his small 
machete a “corn knife,” which comes 
from his childhood in the corn country 
of Iowa.
Double-bit boy’s axe. I can only 
imagine Dick used his short-handled 
double-bit axe. It is the axe seen in the 
photographs and film he took during 
his site preparation and construction 
of his cabin. He also used a single-bit 
boy’s axe and a heavier single-bit axe 
he sometimes called a “pole-axe.”

June 27, 1967: 
I found that what I took to be new blueberries were actually the 
blossoms. It looks like a small off white berry before it opens. A few 
were open today. I checked on the cabin timber where Fred Cowgill cut 
his. Enough there for another cabin I believe.
I included this entry of Dick misidentifying blueberry blossoms because 
as knowledgeable and skilled as he was when he arrived, building a life from 
scratch at Twin Lakes was a new experience. Dick was curious and ready to 
learn. Dick was 51 years old when he started his adventure at Twin Lakes.
July 15, 1967: 
Now was the time for an important project to start. Cut the cabin 
logs. I took the axe, Swede saw, patent peeler and movie camera and 
retired to the cabin log timber. Many good trees there yet and one cabin 
had been cut out of the patch.
 I picked trees about eight inches or a bit more at the butt. Chop 
them down – just as fast as the Swede saw and easier. I sliced a ribbon 
of bark from the top of the log and then loosened it a bit along the 
edges with the axe. I had taken a dead spruce sapling about two inches 
through and sharpened it to a chisel point. With this I got between the 
bark and the log and was surprised how easy and clean the bark came 
off. Sometimes the bark full length of the log would come off in one big 
sheet. In about 30 minutes I could cut, limb and peel a 26-footer. Seven

side logs 21 feet and two end logs 15 feet and one gable log a bit short 
for a good 15-footer. Enough left over on some for gable logs too so I 
did pretty well for five hours work. A few days like that and I will have 
the logs out. The book says cut them in the fall or winter and they won’t 
split so much but will be harder to peel. I think the spring and summer 
cut logs weather to a nicer color yellow (light to dark) where the winter 
cut logs weather grey. A very interesting project – this cabin.
Dick’s Swede saw is a No. 241 crosscut with a 37" blade, made by 
Sandvikens Jernverhs in Sandviken, Sweden. Spike Carrithers brought it 
to Twin Lakes. The initials ‘GHC’ for Gail (Spike) Hemphill Carrithers are 
carved into the handle. Dick sometimes referred to it as his long crosscut saw. 
New, the teeth where likely about 7/8" in height with a ‘V’ gullet between each 
tooth. Dick’s many years of sharpening the saw with a rectangular file short-
ened the teeth and made the ‘V’ gullet flat between each tooth. 
I used this saw in the restoration of Dick’s cabin, and to rip boards for 
tables, a countertop and benches for Spike’s cabin and for the Ranger cabin 
on the lower lake. I am frequently asked how Dick could saw boards with 
consistent thickness using this saw. This saw, with its wide blade, wants to 
saw a straight cut if the teeth are evenly set and the user starts the cut straight.

Patent peeler. Made from a dead 
sapling, the wood was harder than if 
made from a live tree. In mid-July, 
a tree’s sap flows in its cambium 
just under the bark, allowing Dick’s 
lightweight peeler to separate the bark 
from the log thus leaving the surface 
unmarred by axe or drawknife. (Photo

Starting from Scratch
It takes work but it’s not as difficult as one might think to cut a good-looking 
board of even thickness. This is a satisfaction that craftspersons today seldom 
create the freedom to experience.
Dick’s No. 241 does not rip as efficiently as a long rip saw.
July 20, 1967: 
After lunch I would go back and take inventory on my logs. See how 
they run for length and size on the small end. Took my patent log car-
rier along to see if it might work. It may but I wouldn’t bet much money 
that it will. So I looked around for something to make a skidder. I found 
a seasoned spruce about 21/2-inches through. Cut a three-foot length for 
a T handle to pull by. A 41/2-foot piece to fasten to the log at an angle 
so in pulling I would lift the end of the log slightly. I took it back and 
tried it. Moved a 21-footer to the cabin site in no more than 15 minutes. 
Two men could walk right along with most logs I think.

Chapter 1
Dick used gas-can metal to fasten the T-handle of the skidder to the shaft. 
Another piece of gas-can metal nailed to the end of the shaft of the skidder was 
wrapped around and nailed to the small end of the log being pulled. A few 
wraps of rope added extra connection between the skidder and the log. 
Dick’s “cabin log timber” area was easy to find several hundred yards up 
the trail behind his woodshed when I arrived in 2000. By 2009, the stumps 
were badly decayed and are now mostly overgrown with a lingonberry and 
mossberry ground cover. The Twin Lakes wilderness is slowly reclaiming its 
natural character. When I removed a few trees for the restoration of Dick’s 
cabin I cut them off flush with the ground and put a layer of living ground 
cover over them, leaving no evidence of their absence.
July 24, 1967: 
Today I would deck the cabin logs for seasoning. I cut nine chunks 
from a ten-inch spruce I had grubbed out – three for each of three 
stringer-logs the length of the cabin site. I trimmed the knots and 
humps from the end logs and lay them crosswise on the stringers then 
the side logs the other way (length wise). It started to rain when I was 
about a quarter through and by the time I had finished at 11:30 water 
was running in my eyes out of my stocking cap – but they are all set 
for the winter. I may add a few more to be sure. I have enough without 
using a bad one or two.
In Chapter 5 Dick journals about making furniture and other handcraft 
for his cabin from sections of this same grubbed-out spruce.
It rained on and on. I built a fire and got dried out. Popped some 
corn. Worked on a floor plan for the cabin. I think the best I can do is 
12' x 16'. A door and four windows. One at least two by three feet. I don’t 
like to leave the door open to get enough light. A fireplace would be no 
problem. Sand is close and so is plenty of rock the right size. Double deck 
bunks to save space. Stove out where you can walk around it. A good roof. 
I like moss that is good insulation but a fire hazard in early spring. Cedar 
shingles would be second choice. With a chainsaw and lumber cutting 
attachment I could cut nearly everything. It is interesting to think and 
plan what one can do with nothing but a few tools.
The above entry leads one to think Dick was considering using a chainsaw 
in the construction of his cabin. But the following spring when he returned to 
start construction, Dick did not bring a chainsaw.
Before returning to Twin Lakes in 1968 to build his cabin, Dick pur-
chased hand tools from Norm Sutliff at Suttlif ’s Hardware in Kodiak, 
Alaska. Norm’s son, Dick Sutliff, visited Dick’s cabin July 3, 2006, and left 
the following message in the guest book on Dick’s desk: “My Dad Norm Sutliff 
age 89 now in Kodiak sold Dick all his tools when he moved here to build this 
cabin. He tried to sell Dick a chain saw but Dick acted insulted and would 
have none of that.” – Dick Sutliff

August 15, 1967: 
Spike, Hope and the little beagle Missie climbed out – back to Twin 
Lakes once more …
Lots of gear and supplies … A new long handle for the one I broke 
in the round point shovel.
Dick likely broke the handle of his round point shovel while removing 
the stump from his building site on July 12. It would have over-stressed the 
handle of almost any tool used for the task. He then wrote Spike and Hope 
Carrithers to bring a new handle. The story of Dick’s No. 2 shovel threads 
though other chapters as it did through his life giving us a little more under-
standing of the man who lived at Twin Lakes. 
September 1, 1967:
Spike and I cut more than thirty poles in a few hours. Jake [Dick’s 
brother Raymond] worked at packing them to the beach where we rafted 
them up and towed them down to the beach near the cabin site. They 
are doing a good job on the roof I think. It will be plenty strong for any 
snow load it might have to carry. If I could find a good stand of pole 
timber I would consider that type roof for my cabin.
The entry above refers to Dick, Jake and Spike helping Dick Weisser cut and 
install a pole rafter roof on Weisser’s cabin in 1967. Dick Weisser did not remove 
the bark from the poles and installed them directly next to each other. 
One year later Dick Proenneke used pole rafters for his own roof 
but removed the bark from the poles and left a space between each rafter. 
Comparing the two, Dick Proenneke’s peeled rafters with spacing 
between created a much cleaner-looking cabin.
September 3, 1967:
After supper Jake and I went down to my home site 
and discussed small details such as where the cache and the 
woodpile should be. Moved some heavy rocks off the beach 
and suddenly it was getting dark.
September 4, 1967: 
Six o’clock … I walked up the beach a few hundred 
yards and then up through the timber towards Hope Creek 
canyon. I picked and ate a few blueberries along the way. 
Fall colors are coming on fast now and it is a pleasure to take 
an early morning walk. I found myself wishing I was staying 
on – at least until after freeze up or even later. If everything 
goes well – next fall I will do that.
Dick Proenneke was ready to start building his cabin when he departed 
Twin Lakes in the fall of 1967. In a 1990 interview with Theodore 
I believe this T-handle was the repair 
that allowed Dick to continue using his 
shovel until the new handle arrived. 
A more thorough look at the life of this 
shovel blade with its new handle is 
included in Chapter 2.

Chapter 1
Karamanski, a professor of history from Loyola University, Dick talked about 
his cabin’s possible inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places: “In 
the meantime, I had scouted this out and checked with BLM [the Bureau of 
Land Management, which managed most of the federal lands in Alaska] and 
it [Twin Lakes] was open [to private five-acre home sites] and so I cut logs, 
only to find that it was closed when I had investigated it and told it was 
open. And so I had a pile of logs waiting to go together and they told me it 
was closed. But for pictures I would put it up anyway. … So this wasn’t to be 
a cabin to live in permanently. It was to be more or less recreation, a place to 
go in the fall.” 
Dick wanted to build a cabin and get legal title to the land. This hap-
pened during a time of great change in the status of land ownership across 
Alaska. From the time Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1868 the lands 
were managed by the U.S. federal government. When Alaska became a state 
in 1959, the state of Alaska sought ownership of lands and Alaska Natives 
sought ownership of the lands where they had traditionally lived. With the 
discovery of oil on the north slope of Alaska, the federal government stopped 
granting titles to land under its jurisdiction until competing land claims could 
be settled. 
Dick’s return to Twin Lakes in 1968 was at a time of uncertainty for the 
future of land ownership across Alaska.
May 21, 1968:
Today was the day to return to Twin Lakes … I suspected that the 
lakes would still be iced over but we could land in the open water where 
the upper lake dumps swift water into the lower lake.
It was good to be back in the wilderness that always seems to be 
at peace with the world. Babe [Alsworth] and I sat on the gravel beach 
and visited awhile. I wrote a couple cards to send back with him … He 
took off and was soon out of sight over the mountains. Now I was alone 
once more and it was a good feeling. Free to plan and do as I pleased. I 
reorganized my gear for packing and must have had a hundred & fifty 
lbs. or more to pack the three and a half miles.
I was anxious to get to the cabin – see if it was as we had left it last 
September … I came to my pile of cabin logs first. Still there but badly 
checked. I came by the guest cabin – just as we had left it. Next the 
main cabin. I lifted the bar and pushed open the door. No one had been 
inside or had been very neat about it if they had. One and three quarters 
hours steady going to make the hike up the lake – not bad time with a 
load… The ice was very rotten and thin. A strong wind would probably 
break it up. I would pack another load so took off. It was tough walking 
with the loose beach gravel, big boulders, snow and ice. This load would 
be heavier – sixty pounds or more. I doubted that three trips would get 
it all.

Starting from Scratch
May 22, 1968: 
I was up with the sun promptly at four o’clock. A heavy white frost 
covered the ground and new ice formed on the open water along the 
lake ice.
It would be a heavy load this trip but I would try it anyway. More 
than a 150 pounds total as I had estimated, I could see that. The sun was 
soon high and bearing down but the snow was holding up better than 
yesterday in the afternoon. It was noon when I reached the cabin and I 
was glad to have everything under cover for rain clouds were forming 
over the mountain ridge to the south.
May 23, 1968:
This afternoon I worked on my tools. Carved a mallet out of a 
spruce chunk. Made a handle for the 13/4" wood auger and a handle for 
Babe Alsworth bringing Dick to Twin 
Lakes in the spring of 1968. (Photo

the wide wood chisel. Also handles for several files. Sharpened all the 
tools, saws, chisels, plane, wood auger, pocketknife, bacon slicer, etc.
Several wood augers were likely part of the three loads of gear Dick packed 
across a frozen landscape. Each auger bit has the same tapered end with 
threaded tip for securing the bit in a handle. Dick fabricated an auger handle 
from a section of a dead spruce limb or trunk with especially dense wood. 
He knew the tapered end of the auger would stress the handle and found a 
rare dead-standing spruce with particularly dense brown wood resembling old 
dark ivory except for the bark beetle tunnels on its grayed surface. Dick used 
various size auger bits to drill mortises on chairs, benches, sawhorse, tables, a 
bunk bed and for installing window ledges.
May 24, 1968:
A day to cut some wood and I made good progress cutting and 
packing in several trees. How much easier it is without a couple feet 
of snow. Good light – an ideal time for a project I had been thinking 
about. Get the return to Twin Lakes on film. I made up a pack, boarded 
up the windows & capped the stovepipe. Took pack, rifle & camera 
Simple cabin building tools, many handcrafted in whole or part. In particular, note Dick’s handcrafted spruce log notch marker, 
handcrafted mallet, and the handcrafted handles of his wood auger and firmer chisel.

down to Hope Creek and proceeded to work this way. A stop at my log 
pile, on to the cabin – opening up – uncovering the windows – uncap-
ping the flu, building a fire, packing water, sawing wood and getting 
my sourdough in working condition. A scenery shot or two – the ice 
and its condition. The new normal lens is a pleasure to use and I should 
have some good shots. Also took some of my cabin building tools in the 
making. The usual late May daily rainstorm was building and soon it 
thundered loud a few times and started to rain and a good strong wind 
came up the lake. The ice started to move and pile up on the beach but 
soon stopped as the wind went down.
I needed a pair of log notch markers so made them out of spruce. 
They are nothing more than a pair of dividers with a pencil on one leg.
Dick’s sense of purpose included filming and taking photographs even 
when he had a cabin and all the furniture to build before winter.

Chapter 1
May 25, 1968: 
The ice started to move down the lake pushed by a good breeze. Not 
the big event that it was last year. Maybe because I had been here longer 
waiting for it to go. This time it is much thinner and there had been no 
wind to break it up.
Just as well get started on the cabin so I took tools and cameras and 
headed for the construction site. I found the logs well-seasoned and very 
light in weight. Not checked as badly as had thought at first. All I saw 
was the weathered side that had checked.
I rolled them away from the building site and picked two of the 
largest and crookedest for the two sides on the ground. One required 
considerable hewing to straighten. The black spruce [white spruce] works 
real nice with axe and draw knife. Next two end logs and the notches 
marked. I plan to make it eleven feet by fifteen feet on the inside.
Time to call it a day so I didn’t get a notch cut.
Dick misidentified the local white spruce that surrounds Twin Lakes as 
black spruce. His cabin, cache, woodshed and handcrafted spruce items are all 
white spruce.
May 26, 1968: 
The ice is moving up the lake pushed by a light breeze … The sun 
was still shining on the lake ice that is very green. A very beautiful sight 
– I had to stop work and take some pictures.

Later as I worked on the second course of logs it rained and I got 
pretty damp but soon the sun was out again. The second course in place 
and now the cabin stands one foot high. Five and one half feet to the 
square I figure – so eight logs per day it won’t take too long. The sea-
soned black spruce looks and works like white pine. I thought Norm 
Sutliff gouged me a little when he charged more than seven dollars for 
my gouge chisel but it is a lifesaver. Next to my axe I consider it my most 
valuable tool. Rough out the notch with saw and axe, then finish it in 
short order with the chisel.
Many patches of open water on the lake but it is still more than 99% 
ice covered.
I never found Dick’s gouge. I believe it was a #7 sweep, approximately 
11/4" wide, made by Greenlee.
May 28, 1968: 
Frost on my logs when I went to work at six. I was sure that I could 
do better than eight logs today but there was to many big and slightly 
crooked logs that I want near the bottom. Even the sorting to get logs 
for opposite sides or ends that match takes time. Getting into better logs 
now so it will speed up a bit.                                       
Eighteen logs in place.

Chapter 1
May 29, 1968: 
I slipped the canoe into the water and paddled to work for a change. 
It was good to dip that paddle and slide silently along.
And again it rained this afternoon. Nearly hard enough to shut 
down construction but not quite. I toughed it out and soon it let up. 
Gremlins were at work on my cabin last night. I found only six logs put 
up yesterday. Today I did better by putting up seven. It would certainly 
be a pleasure to work with first class cabin logs. Mine are not as straight 
as they should be and have too much taper. Make much more work but 
doesn’t look too bad.
May 30, 1968: 
The cabin is shaping up fast. A total of twenty-eight logs in place. 
Forty-four should do it except for gable ends and roof logs. Rain started 
early and I was getting wet. A few flakes of snow mixed in gave an indi-
cation as to what it was doing on the mountains. I quit and came for my 
rain gear and it had nearly stopped when I started work again. Made a 
blunder today. Notched a log and had a real nice fit and was just ready to 
fasten it down when I noticed it was wrong end too. I threw it aside and 
when I was ready for the next log on that side I tried it and by enlarging 
each notch a bit and hewing a bit it will be just right.
May 31, 1968: 
That contrary log of yesterday carried over into today. I carefully 
fitted it and fastened it down and was selecting logs for the next course 
when I looked up and to my great surprise saw that it was still wrong 
end to. Two big ends together are proper but not three and it was the 
third. I pried it off and flung it off to the side. Finally used it on the end 
that is the only place it could possibly work. Thirty-five logs in place 
now. Nine to go and I will be ready for the gables.
June 1, 1968:
On the job by 5:45 and had two logs in place when I heard a plane. 
The fog had nearly cleared the mountains. I knew it must be Babe so 
started for the point [the sandy point at Spike’s cabin]. Sure enough – the 
old “T” craft glided in for a perfect landing on the calm lake. The sun 
was out in force by now and such a beautiful day is hard to imagine.
Groceries and lots of mail. 50 pounds of sugar, 50 pounds of flour. 
A good 21/2 gallons of honey. About 60 pounds of spuds. 2 dozen 
eggs. A half slab of bacon, bacon grease. I had asked him for a start of 
rhubarb and sure enough he had that too. And some books – as we sat 
on the bench at the lower end he asked me if I would read some if he 
brought them. He didn’t forget them as they are a bit religious.
I read my mail and got on with my planting. Four settings of rhu-
barb, 15 hills of spuds, peas, carrots, beets, rutabagas and onion sets. If 
everything grows I can supply the Twin Lakes community in great style.
 17
Starting from Scratch
Back to my cabin building. Thirty-eight logs in place now and nearly 
ready for the eave logs if I don’t decide to go one higher. I had intended 
to keep it low.
Dick’s rhubarb plants still come up early each spring and provided treats 
for us each summer.
June 2, 1968:
Such a fine evening I hated to waste it – so I took the canoe and 
paddled down to my cabin site for a view offshore. Then I decided to 
paddle over to whitefish point in search of some tall straight house roof 
poles. The lake was flat calm and a pleasure to travel. I found some poles 
but no great amount. It was after ten when I beached on this side.
June 3, 1968:
A real good day at the cabin job. Six logs in place. Now I am ready 
for the eave logs and the gables. Marked out the windows and door and 
will cut at least enough in each log to get the saw through after I put the 
eave logs on.
June 4, 1968:	
A good day for building and I made progress. Put up the two eave 
logs, cut the openings for three windows and the door and have one 
gable log about ready to fasten. After the gables, purlin logs and ridge 
log I must hew out some 2" x 6" stuff to cover the log ends in windows 
and door. Finally I looked at my watch – six thirty – past time to start 
supper. The end of a real good day.
June 5, 1968:
Good progress today – the gables up, the purlin logs on and also the 
ridge log. It is certainly a good thing that I went one log higher with the 
walls or I would have to dig out for headroom. Even now a six-footer 
won’t have any to spare.
The next project is to trim the ends of the gable logs and also the 
ends of the wall logs. All were plenty long so there will be no short ones.
June 7, 1968:
As the fog cleared out it promised to be a fair day. A good day to 
cut the cabin down to size. Trim the roof logs for length, trim the gable 
logs to the slope of the roof and trim the wall logs on all four corners. It 
really took on a neat appearance in a hurry. Many pictures were taken 
which took time also. Ten days from the time I cut the first notch. I do 
need window and door frames and roof poles if I can find some. My logs 
came out just right. Only four full-length leftover and only one of them 
was a halfway decent log.
I had a job lined up and was anxious to see if it would work. I would 
make and install my door and window frames out of native wood. I built

Chapter 1
me a bench to work on then selected straight-grained sections of logs 
cut from window and door opening. Chalked a line down each side. 
With Babe’s thin wide chisel I cut deep along the line on each side. 
Then drove the hand axe into the end to split them apart. I smoothed 
the split side with the drawknife then lay them flat side down and chalk 
a line along each side making them 13/4" thick. I hewed to the line with 
the axe and smoothed them with the drawknife. I left the edges as they 
were. Put in place and nailed in they look real good. Next I would clean 
up the chips. I stacked them all in front of the door and it was quite a 
pile for eleven days work.
Now for the chinking. I think that I will try mixing moss and loose 
oakum to cut down on the amount of oakum required for the job. Moss 
is good if it has something to make it stronger and hold it in. Then I 
must get some roof poles.
Dick later used Babe’s thin wide chisel to make an ice chisel. It is shown 
in the following chapter on Page 83.
Splitting usable boards from a log is laborious. The grain in almost every 
spruce at Twin Lakes spirals to some degree and the log wants to split along 
the grain. It is not always apparent if there is a spiral to the grain on some 
Rather than sawing boards, Dick split the boards and then 
flattened them with an axe and drawknife. (Photos by

Starting from Scratch
logs, even once the bark has been removed. Dick no doubt selected a log as free 
of spiral grain as he could. His door and window jambs, split with a chisel 
and hammer and then smoothed with an axe and drawknife, are my favorites 
of all the boards at Dick’s cabin. Dick did not saw the edges of these boards 
square and straight, instead he left their natural edges as a perfect complement 
to his log walls.
Dick did not fully smooth the boards he split. He did not strive to make 
store-bought boards. Each and every board Dick split and later sawed is 
smooth to the touch while showing its handcrafted origin. 
Oakum is a fibrous material used to fill the gaps between the hull planks 
on wooden boats. Dick used non-oiled oakum mixed with a little moss to seal 
the cracks between his cabin logs. He used oiled oakum between the cabin 
logs and roofing tarpaper. Dick may have brought the oakum from Kodiak 
or Spike Carrithers may have had enough left over from chinking their cab-
ins. On Kodiak Island, oakum would have been a common product to chink 
wooden fishing boats. Dick learned to chink wooden boats with oakum during 
WWII as a carpenter’s helper. 
Chinking between logs is not glamorous work. Dick’s chinking has stayed 
in place remarkably well, requiring only a few minutes of maintenance each 
year to keep the cabin tight.
June 8, 1968:
Today was the day to chink the cabin. First I moved the mound 
of chips and then gathered some moss and spread it on the beach to 
dry a bit. There is still ice under the six-inch thick moss in the woods. 
I used straight oakum in the narrow seams and the mixture of oakum 
and moss where the opening was more than quarter inch. Straight 
oakum is easier to use there is no doubt about that. About three hours 
more should finish the job. It will be a tight cabin no doubt about that. 
Tomorrow I must scout for a good patch of poles for the roof. 
June 9, 1968:
Today, Sunday, a day away from the job of building. I would look for 
pole timber and as I had been thinking of the country where the caribou 
bulls spend the summer I would go up the lake and the river towards 
the glacier country. It is always an adventure to visit that wild and very 
beautiful country.
I found suitable poles not more than a mile above the cabin. I would 
cut and raft them up in the lake and when a breeze is fair tow them 
down with the canoe.
June 10, 1968: 
To finish chinking the cabin took longer than I thought. To finish 
the day I put a log under the bottom log in front to plug an opening 
there and the same in back and chinked them both. Now I am ready for 
roof poles that I will start cutting tomorrow.

Chapter 1
In 2003, when I replaced the rotted sill logs of Dick’s cabin I found the 
logs Dick put under each end. They were held in place only by the cabin’s 
weight. Dick would have appreciated the added height these logs gave to the 
cabin’s interior. 
To replace the bottom logs, it was not possible to lift the cabin since the cabin 
was anchored to Dick’s rock fireplace. National Park Historian John Branson 
assisted with digging a trench under Dick’s cabin to execute, in essence, upside 
down log fitting. I made every effort to fit the logs to match Dick’s work and then 
backfill with gravel to the exact level it had originally been. 
June 11, 1968: 
I took the canoe and paddled up the lake to the foot of Crag 
Mountain. This would be a pole cutting day. Good poles were not as 
plentiful as I had figured and I worked pretty steady to get forty-eight 
cut and packed to the beach by noon. It was really warm with no air 
moving and the sun beating down. The mosquitoes were out in force.
This afternoon I would peel some poles to see how it goes. I made a 
tripod of short sticks to rest one end of the pole on and stuck the other 
end in the bank. I used the drawknife and the bark did fly. I thought I 
was doing pretty well until I looked at my watch. Ten past six and I had 
peeled twenty-five.
June 12, 1968: 
Back to the pole peeling job up along the high bank where the sun 
really beats down and the mosquitoes can be a bother.
About nine I heard a plane. 
The poles all peeled and they totaled more than fifty. I rafted them 
up and moved them down the lake and to my beach. A pretty good pile 
of poles but I doubt if there will be enough.
June 13, 1968: 
I thought what a good day it would be to gather and peel more 
poles. The sun breaking through and a cool breeze coming up the lake. 
A much better day for working than yesterday.
Still time to get some poles so I went to the cabin and then over 
across Hope Creek and found four. Next I went up in my cabin log 
country and found ten or twelve. I got set up and peeled seven before it 
was time to get supper.
June 14, 1968: 
I peeled the remainder of my roof poles and trimmed the knots. 
Now to put them on and how close. I decided on five inches center to 
center and plug the slot over the wall log. One side nearly done and the 
other about half. About ten more to go and I must hunt more poles. 
About thirty if my calculations are right.

If all goes well Babe will come flying in tomorrow. I hope he doesn’t 
forget my two handsaws.
June 15, 1968: 
A good opportunity to hunt more roof poles and I would look down 
country below Marshall Farmers this trip. 
I found poles and good ones. I cut fifteen – enough for one trip. 
I tied the small ends side by side, ran the canoe into the butt ends far 
enough to tie to the front cross bar of the canoe and leaving me room 
to paddle. It worked real well – slow but I made good time. The rain 
had stopped so I could get out of the rain gear and get the poles peeled. 
I was through by noon. This afternoon I finished the front end of the 
cabin roof and took count. Now I needed seventeen more. I scouted 
around back of the cabin and found seven and peeled three of those. 
Time to call it a day.
June 16, 1968: 
Today I secured the roof poles over the gables and chinked them. 
Secured the poles on the ends outside the walls. Gathered ten more 
poles – peeled and put them on. The roof takes time. 100 poles to 
gather, transport and peel. Then trim the knots and notch them to fit. 
One more pole needed. Soon I will be ready to saw the ends and fill the 
slots between the poles under the eaves.

and barely standing) along the trail

June 17, 1968:
Breakfast over and the chores done by five fifteen so I went to work. 
Finished putting the roof poles on. Sawed the pole ends off to the proper 
eighteen inches. Evened the ends up a bit by trimming top or bottom. 
Now I was ready for the chore of plugging the gap between poles on top 
the wall logs. It takes a lot of cutting and fitting but it must be done.
Tomorrow should see the roof ready for tarpaper, polyethylene and 
moss. Next I will finish the inside, kitchen counter, table, bench and a 
stand for water bucket and washbasin. And I think I shall build a double 
deck bunk.
Last evening after supper I went down to Hope Creek for try at 
fishing and got snagged in the rocks so came back for the canoe. While 
I was at it I took my axe… I would go down below the Farmer cabin for 
a few poles.
June 18, 1968:	
Back to the roof job. Seems a pole roof takes a lot of time but then 
there is a lot of work involved and all of it slow. I finished filling the 
slots between the poles and hewed the blocks all down to the height 
of the poles. Caulked the joint on each side of each block with oakum. 
Then a strip of the oiled oakum down each side and over the gables. 
Protection against a pesky squirrel going up through the tarpaper and 
down the inside I hope.
Then I chinked around the blocks on the outside and caulked the 
windows and doorframe while I was about it. Then inside and chinked 
all the corner joints of the logs. Any place I could get a table knife blade 
in got oakum. I was busy but noticed it getting dark. 
Twenty days to get the cabin to its present stage of construction.
June 20, 1968:
 On the cabin – I found a bit more chinking to do. I would chink 
around the filler blocks between the roof poles. Also around the purlin 
logs where they go through the gables and the corner joints on the out-
side as well as inside. I cleaned up the chips for the second time and had 
a good big pile of them.
Now a job I had been thinking about. Making table 
top and also counter top and window ledges and also 
shelves. I could split the logs straight enough but there 
were many slivers and it was a job to get them halfway 
smooth. I made two and then decided to try ripping one 
with Fred Cowgill’s old ripsaw. That was the answer. I could 
go down the middle of a five-inch log in fifteen minutes. The 
log being forty-two inches long. Couldn’t complain about that. 
I think I have nearly everything sawed that I need. Now to trim 
the edges and start building…

It rained a few showers so I got the 16' x 10' piece of polyethylene 
and covered the over hang in front. A dry place to work and my tools in 
the dry. Six thirty was the time before I knew it.
Fred Cowgill’s old ripsaw was stolen from Cowgill’s cabin in 2013 by 
the same two men who stole Dick’s gold pan and chinking tool. None of the 
items have been retrieved. Year after year, with very few exceptions, we were 
impressed with the care and reverence people showed while visiting Dick’s home. 
June 21, 1968:
A day to make lumber. Hew off the round side of my slabs and trim 
the edges. I also ripped out 2 planks for my door and will need two 
more. Soon I will be ready to put things together.
 June 22, 1968:
To show his appreciation for the long hours of daylight I think a 
person should see one [24-hour day] around the clock.
Down to my cabin and started to work on the boards for my counter 
top when I heard another plane. This was Babe I knew. … Glen [Babe 
Alsworth’s youngest son, Glen] climbed out on the pilots side. So that little 
guy in the eighth grade next year was flying the old T craft. Lots of gro-
ceries, rhubarb, oranges, grapefruit, bananas and a lot of mail. … Even 
a few two-inch planks, some spikes and five handsaws. Two of them 
mine, the others to be sharpened. We went down to see my cabin. Babe 
walked around and said several times. This sure is a nice cabin …
If I wanted anything big flown in now was my chance. Babe said 
he might stay over here one night while doing the job. How about a 
50-gallon barrel or two. Good to store stuff in so the varmints can’t get 
at it. I should have him bring in cement for my fireplace.

Dick left three handsaws in the cache when he departed Twin Lakes. They 
were wrapped in several layers of 1969 Trade-A-Plane newspaper.
June 23, 1968:
Today, Sunday, a day to take up the slack. Saws to sharpen. That’s 
an easy job. Five of them and some in pretty bad shape. That job out 
of the way I looked for a log to make more 2-inch planks for my cabin 
door. I found one in my wood supply. It would make two planks nine 
inches wide. With the two I had that should do it. I got my tools and 
marked out the planks. It would take some ripping to make three cuts 
51 inches long and ten deep. I went at it and by three pm I had it done. I 
could use the slabs for bench tops or stool tops or whatever. I loaded the 
whole business in the canoe and hauled it down. Did a bit more chink-
ing on the inside around the door and window frames.
Having made a few boards by splitting them from a log, Dick ripped 
all of the remaining boards in constructing his cabin and furniture. Ripping 
boards with a handsaw takes time but results in a much cleaner surface than 
ones split from a log.
Dick used a jack plane to smooth the sawn boards for his desk, table and 
countertops, resulting in a finished appearance while retaining the furniture’s 
handcrafted origin. 
When I saw boards from a log, I first lay the log horizontal and, using 
a level, make a vertical line down the middle of each end of the log. I snap a 
chalk line along the length of the log on both sides, and then mark another line 
parallel to the centerline, to the width of the board being cut. I start sawing 
by following the line along the log’s length and across the end of the log. As the 
sawing progresses, I roll the log and saw from the opposite side thus sawing 
Geo. H. Bishop & Co. handsaw with 
five teeth per inch, a 15" blade and 
a cast-aluminum handle (left) and 
another handsaw found at Twin Lakes 
(below). (Photos by Harper’s Ferry

along the line on one side of the log for a distance then switch to sawing the 
line from the other side. This way I saw a straight line. I prefer to saw one 
board at a time from one side of the log. Occasionally I use a wedge to keep the 
saw kerf from pinching the saw. Also, adjusting where and how the log is held 
steady will help keep the saw kerf from pinching.
June 24, 1968:
Today on my job a few more boards to hew out and then start the 
inside. Window ledges for three windows. A five-foot shelf over the 
door and the start of the kitchen counter. Pretty well cut out and ready 
to put on the wall. I augured 11/2" holes in the wall logs to take the sup-
ports for the counter. There will be no legs on the floor. Tomorrow I’ll 
do what I can towards the table and make the door and then the double 
deck bunk.
June 25, 1968: 
I accomplished quite a lot on the cabin today. Ripped the planks 
that I made Sunday. Now the door is ready to put together. I think I 
shall make it a Dutch door. Made the legs for my table. Auger four holes 
and it will be ready to assemble. Installed three window ledges. Cut the 
two 16" x 24" window sash to fit the frames. Installed half of my counter 
framework. Made and installed three shelves in the kitchen area. 
Tomorrow I think I will work on the double deck bunk.

June 26, 1968: 
Today I built the double bunk. Four posts with two rails on each 
side and two large and two small on each end. I augered inch and one 
half holes and trimmed the rail poles to fit. I got it put together and 
it looked to big so I shortened the end rails. Still to big so I cut them 
again. Have it down to 27-inch width inside the side rails now and it 
looks much better. It turned out a bit long to suit me so I shortened it a 
bit. Now when I get some glue I will knock it apart and glue it together. 
The day about used up I cleaned up the area of scraps and chips. 
Tomorrow I will set the legs for my table and build a stool and a bench.
June 27, 1968:
Today would be a day to look for ten more poles to finish my roof 
and about twenty to make the slats for my bunks. Those would have to 
be small but yet have good length that is a tough combination. I paddled 
down country from the Farmer cabin and got the ten large ones but no 
small ones to suit me …

Starting from Scratch
I went down to the cottonwood grove and was tempted to cut some 
saplings but couldn’t see enough straight ones. Then I struck it rich. A 
spruce thicket such as I haven’t seen in this country. Spruce saplings an 
inch or a bit over at the butt and ten feet tall – just what I needed and 
had enough for my need in a short while. Thirty of them I loaded in the 
canoe and paddle across the lake that was still flat calm.
A job for after noon. Peel all the poles and get rid of the bark… I 
finished my pole peeling job and a few for stool and bench legs, cleaned 
up the bark and it was time to call it a day.
 June 28, 1968: 
Today I would build some furniture. First a kitchen chair and then a 
bench three feet long. I had them both ready to glue by 11:30.
Back on the job I augured the hole for my table legs and the bunk 
poles were ready. I could sort, cut and fit them in. I’m near the end of 
the job of building on the cabin until I get a plane, glue and polyeth-
ylene for the roof. By the time I had the scraps cleaned up and tools 
sharpened as I do every evening it was time to call it a day.
In 1995, Dick wrote, “My chair still giving trouble. One back rest sup-
port broke off at the hole in the seat foundation. I would shorten it a bit and 
shape a new end to fit in the hole with the broken support end. Working like a 
beaver when here came a Cessna 180.”

Chapter 1
In 2001, a black bear broke the chair when it climbed through Dick’s 
nine-pane window to pull the chair and its caribou fur pad outside. I repaired 
Dick’s chair only to have it break when someone leaned back too far. I repli-
cated his chair, repaired this new break and sent Dick’s chair to the archives.
In replicating the chair, I particularly focused on drilling the mortise holes 
for the legs and back rest at angles matching Dick’s. The chair’s stance, the splay 
and rake of the legs, along with the angle of the backrest support-post, make it 
a beautiful and comfortable chair. The back legs splay back a few degrees more 
than the front legs, and the back legs are slightly shorter. The chair looks sim-
ple but most handcrafted chairs at wilderness cabins are not crafted like this. 
Dick’s matter-of-fact approach did not mean a thrown together, uncomfort-
able chair. And constructing a handsome chair did not mean taking all day.
When a black bear, in 2015, managed to turn the handle of Dick’s door 
and pull out my replicated chair with a new caribou pad along with Dick’s 
four-legged stool with his original caribou pad, it was apparent the fur cre-
ated an attracting odor. All fur was removed from Dick’s cabin. 
June 29, 1968: 
Today I would put the hinges on my windows. I need a three legged 
stool and also a book rack type of shelf set up to store books, camera 
gear, clothes, etc. This would take some doing as it would be three 
shelves three feet long and ranging from fifteen inches to twelve in 
Dick’s kitchen 
chair. It resided 
at his table.

width. Lots of ripping to turn out that much lumber. Rip two four-inch 
poles to make four posts. One two-inch to fill in between. Three logs 
36 inches long ripped twice to make a board & two slabs. I gouged the 
surface to get rid of the saw marks and put it together. It looks pretty 
neat I think. That is enough furniture. Now to install the roof jack to take 
the stovepipe and put some pegs in the walls to hang stuff on. With the 
35 inch overhang of the roof in front there is much room to hang much 
stuff that is better off outside than in …
Tomorrow Sunday and a day to go some place.
June 30, 1968: 
Last evening after supper I decided I would paddle down to the 
connecting stream and try for a couple trout.
A third of the way down a breeze met me and as time went by it 
got stronger. Opposite low pass creek it was a battle to keep headway so 
I headed for the right shore. I finally made Emerson creek … I found 
several uprooted trees that would make hinges but it would take some 
carving. Following the beach to the lower end I saw a few in the drift on 
the beach. I may get some and see what I can do. Steel hinges are better 
no doubt but it is interesting to see what one can do using only material 
from the forest.
I had no watch but it must have been midnight when I left the 
beach. It was a beautiful clear night and a good breeze to help me along. 
It was one thirty when I got the trout cleaned and already the north-
eastern sky was getting lighter … Not long till sun up so I sawed a few 
blocks of wood … Filed a couple handsaws.

Took a walk up the beach towards the base of Crag mountain. 
Finally Gold mountain caught the first rays of the sun and I turned in 
for a few hours.
Dick was living a good life, choosing the freedom to do as he pleased. 
Reading his entries, I imagine his energy felt boundless.
July 1, 1968:
I augered many holes and drove wooden pegs to hang clothes, tools 
and other articles both inside and outside the cabin.
Now the roof jack for the stove. Select the proper location – nail a 
cross tie to support the two roof poles I must cut. I reinforced the base 
of the roof jack to make it wider and stiffer. I will put the pipe up so it 
will stay without wires. A few sheet metal screws should do it.
Dick’s spruce wall pegs are of various sizes. His Twin Lakes tools included 
a Stanley brace and several bits. He would have used this brace to auger the 
mortise holes for the pegs rather than use his hand auger with its larger- 
diameter bits. Years later, Dick used his Stanley brace to make an ice auger.
Dick’s sheet-metal screws were all used aircraft sheet-metal screws he or 
his brother Raymond [Jake] salvaged.
July 2, 1968:
My roof poles still wet. I would go down country for my hinge tim-
ber. A nice trip down on the glassy water.
I figured I would need the butt end of eight small trees 4 inch or 
more to make 4 hinges. I scouted around and found ten just in case I 
had a bad one or two. A few good looking rocks from Emerson creek 
found their way into the canoe too. I had a good load. The lake still 
flat calm. I would see the difference in traveling time between a loaded 
canoe and empty. One hour to the minute to my cabin site from the 
lower end. I doubt if I have ever beat that over a very few minutes run-
ning empty.
I was anxious to try this business of making hinges. Frank Bell had 
made some for his cabin but they were very crude. Where to make the 
first cut. Square across the lower end to get a flat surface to start from. 
Then a cut up the trunk. Now I had a flat side and end. Then square off 
one side. Measure the proper thickness and rip off the other side. Now 
it was flat on three sides. The remaining side would be the outside of the 
hinge. With the butt end to form the hinge I worked it to shape with 
axe and draw knife. I had half of the hinge in forty-five minutes – not 
bad. Still raining when I went back from lunch. Another tree made the 
other half with the blade to fit in the fork. To my surprise the next tree 
made a complete hinge. Two more to go and the hinges will be ready to 
auger holes for the hinge pins. The hinges are long enough to form the 
batten holding the door planks together.

Chapter 1
Quitting time and it really started to rain so I sat in the door and 
honed my cutting tools to a real good edge.
Frank Bell’s cabin was across the lake and upcountry from Dick’s. The 
roof was starting to fall in 2000 but his “very crude” hinges still operated. 
Today the roof has collapsed and the door no longer swings.
July 3, 1968:
Back to the workshop. I picked a stump that would turn out a 
complete hinge I hoped and sure enough it did. It saves two cuts to get 
both halves out of the same stick. A hinge and a half by lunchtime and 
by two o’clock I had all four made all they need are the holes augered for 
the pins.
Calm and only partly cloudy a good time to put the roof jack and 
the tarred felt on the roof – so I went at it. Lap four inches over the 
top from each side and five and one quarter the rest of the way to the 
eaves. That made it come out just right at the lower edge. I got a pretty 
good start ... but ran out of paper. Need just one strip twenty feet long. 
It looked better with a roof on such as it is and I took a couple pic-
tures. When I get the moss on and the poles on top then she will look 
completed.
Tomorrow the 4th. I am undecided what to do. I would like to take 
a trip but old Babe might just pick the 4th to fly in so I had better stick 
around close. I have work I could do.
July 4, 1968:
I finished the tarpaper job on the roof first thing. Looks real neat 
and if I only had the polyethylene I could finish it up. I worked on the 
hinges. Auger the holes for the 7/ 8" hinge pins of spruce. I am anxious 
to see how the door will look and operate.
Dick augered the 7/8" holes through four hinges exactly perpendicular to 
the mated surfaces of each hinge and equal distance from the hinge surface 
that fits against the door planks. This is the most extreme example of Dick’s 
eye-hand coordination. Drilling off perpendicular by even the slightest degree 
would cause the door to bind when opening.
I had seen a bunch of gas cans on the beach by Lofstedt’s [Lofstedt’s 
cabin]. I would paddle up and see if they were still there. It was a year ago 
that I saw them. 55 minutes to paddle up to his landing. I checked his 
cabin that is in an awful shape. Aluminum roofing on one side and partly 
the other. The clear plastic is gone and half of the one side open to the 
weather. Really a shame with the perfect timber he had to build it with.
I took a walk behind his cabin. Poles, all kinds of them, tall and 
straight. I needed two twenty footers not over four inches at the butt. I 
had no trouble finding them. I had seen an old dull axe at the cabin so I 
chopped two down and packed them to the canoe. No gas cans in sight

except a couple at the cabin. Next I visited the Tri-Pacer for the two 
wing tank cover panels. I could use them for something.
The shortest of the two poles is only inches too long. I peeled only 
the outer layer of bark so they would weather a dark brown.
Something else I need – a woodshed of a sort to keep wood in out of 
the rain and snow. I plan to build it maybe 12' x 8' and put the toilet on one 
end. I would built it on the order of a log shelter – open in front – a gable 
roof with only a narrow roof over the open front to keep rain and snow 
from blowing in. I could set my sawbuck under the overhang. I cleared the 
brush for this project – soon I must cut a few logs, maybe twelve.

Chapter 1
Bud Lofstedt, a big game guide from Kenai, built his cabin at the head of 
the upper lake about three miles upcountry from Dick’s. The “Tri-Pacer” refers 
to a wheel plane that crashed near Lofstedt’s cabin. When Dick left Twin 
Lakes for periods of time he nailed one of the aluminum tank cover panels 
from the Tri-Pacer over his large window. It is still used today to cover the 
window through the winter. The Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer four-place aircraft 
was produced between 1953 and 1960.
July 5, 1968:
Today was the day. No plane and no roof covering so I would start 
on my wood shelter and toilet. I cleared the area of brush and moss and 
was surprised to find ice just under the moss. It is certainly wonderful 
insulation. That done I looked for trees and cut and peeled eleven by ten 
past twelve.
After lunch I packed in the logs and got busy at putting them 
together. I would make it 12' long and six feet wide at the ground. A 
gable roof with a three-foot overhang in front.
July 6, 1968:
Hew and notch and fight mosquitoes again today. I am now six high 
with my logs. I must have started with an extra long one as some were 
too short and it really hurt to cut them to seven feet when they were 
only six inches short for a thirteen footer. So – I had to scrounge for six 
more and found them. Have them all peeled and packed in ready for 
Monday morning.

July 7, 1968:
Fog to the mountain tops and I slept in till 4:45 for a change. Today 
would be a day to take up the slack.
More letters I could write and I have about a dozen ready to go now.
An hour before supper. I read a couple of Babe’s little books. Strange 
how the bible predicts so many things have come to pass. And the end is 
very near it says. I hope to have time to finish my cabin before it does.
July 10, 1968:
Three thirty and I heard a plane and it sounded like the T craft… 
Babe had everything packed in and was walking down the beach towards 
my cabin when I met him … He also brought me a big heavy Stanley 
jackplane – dull as a hoe and rusty as if it had never been inside. Lots of 
mail to read and then the plane to get in shape. The ribbons will fly now.
July 11, 1968:
How nice it was to have the tarpaper roof overhead. A good time 
to put that jack plane to work so I moved my bench under the overhang 
and proceeded to make shavings. All the boards for shelves, counter and 
table had to be planed on both sides and the two edges. Also the planks 
for the door. Must have been close to thirty-five and the shavings began 
to pile up. It continued to rain for an hour or more and then let up long 
enough for me to unload the canoe. I would go back for another load but 
a look down the lake showed ruffled water moving up country. Better 
wait. It was a good breeze and the lake got rough for an hour or so. By 
the time I had finished I had more shavings piled up than I have ever 
made in a day before. I fitted the boards for the shelf under the counter 
and got the table ready to put together as soon as my glue arrives.
A special treat for supper. Lettuce & green onions. The lettuce was 
good but no better than fireweed and fireweed is easier to gather. Just 
pick the tops into a bowl and put a bit of salt, some sugar and a little 
vinegar. Greens of the wilderness first class.
July 12, 1968:
This morning I got my table boards ready to assemble and then 
came the job of putting the door hinges on. Get all those hinge pins 
exactly in line I put the top one on and then hung my plumb bob from 
the center of the hinge pin. Put the bottom one on next then no. 3 and 
last no. 2. I think that I have them close enough. When I get more 
glue and some nails I will make it a door. Next I cut my door planks 
to length and ripped the last one to make the width right. Saw out and 
plane the doorstop molding and some for the big window sash.
July 15, 1968:	
Today I would build the toilet in the woodshed. A very technical job 
requiring a lot of thought so as not to have it turn out unsatisfactory. I

think I have it just right and also room for a half dozen empty gas cans. 
Finishing the front and making the door requires time. Ripping boards 
from the last of my cabin logs.
July 16, 1968:
My day’s work was cut out for me today. Build the front facing for 
the John. I had ripped boards to frame the door and for the area above 
the door so put the old jackplane to work and soon had them smooth. 
Now the door 64" high and 25" wide … It would take some ripping to 
put out better than ten board feet. I had a log spotted in my firewood 
supply up at the cabin. I brought my tools and measured it up. Make five 
Outhouse door and gas-can hinges.

boards an inch thick and two slabs. It measured six inches on the small 
end and eight on the big end. I laid it out and chalked my lines. Set 
and filed Fred Cowgill’s ripsaw and went to work. 9:30 when I started 
and 12 o’clock when I finished. A good bunch of boards. Four would 
make the door and the other the cleats to hold it together. After lunch 
I trimmed the edges and planed both sides and the edges. About five 
hours or a bit more from the log to the finished door. About a $30.00 
door at Alaskan wages. Hinges I would make from gas can tin. Three of 
them 33/4" wide and they look pretty nice. Saw out the moon crescent in 
the door and it was ready to hang. Looks just like it did on the blueprint.
It rained a good shower for awhile and I sawed and planed and I was 
thankful for the good overhang of the roof in front of the cabin.
July 17, 1968: 
Today would be a good one. I finished up my masterpiece in the 
woodshed except for poles to make the partition between it and the 
wood storage post. I trimmed the ends of the roof poles to length and 
that was about it till I get some spikes and polyethylene.
Twenty-foot half-round fascia boards.
Here I’m using the Sandvikens No. 241 
to rip a spruce pole to replace Dick’s rotted 
half-round fascia in 2000.

Starting from Scratch
Something had been bothering me. Those roof pole ends on the 
cabin didn’t look very professional. Why not rip one of my twenty-foot 
poles from Lofstedt’s and put half on each side to cover the ends so – I 
ripped her and it didn’t take so long. Just what the doctor ordered. They 
helped the looks of the cabin 100%.
Ripping a 20' pole, in 2000, to replace Dick’s rotted half-log fascia 
was the first time I used the 3' Sandvikens No. 241. First I sharpened it 
using Dick’s saw vise (illustrated in Chapter 9, Page 378). Keeping the pole 
straight was surprisingly simple, and creating my own half-round fascia was 
as rewarding as anything I could imagine. 
That just about winds her up. Coming near the end. I cleaned out 
the chips from in and around the woodshed and in front of the cabin. 
Cleaned up the scraps. Packed the spare poles back to the pole storage 
area. Really slicked the place up and took a picture from the lake.
I could work on my stove stand but I doubt if I will need it, women 
can be balky at times. I need a good sawbuck. I could rig the poles for 
my bunk beds. I nailed them to a strip at the big end so I can just drag 
them out to get at the gas can storage under the bunks.
Tomorrow if it is fair and calm I will visit the choice pole thicket on 
the other side of the lake.
July 18, 1968:
Wasted enough time so back to work. I built the stove stand and a 
good sawbuck.

Chapter 1
Dick’s new sawbuck is the only thing he made at Twin Lakes that looks 
clumsy. The legs at one end look too splayed and the other two look stilted. He 
mortised all four legs with a stilted stance making it unstable when he sawed 
firewood. In the 1975 journal entry below, Dick’s remedy was to saw two legs 
off and auger two more mortise holes for legs with a greater splay. 
When parts of his sawbuck broke due to old age and rot, I repaired it, 
replicated it and sent the original to the NPS archives. Examining Dick’s 
sawbuck, I found a rare example of Dick failing on his first attempt to drill 
mortises at a perfect angle for the job at hand. My replicated sawbuck matches 
Dick’s work, including the two sawn-off legs. 
August 25, 1975: 
Lunch out of the way and Jake retired to the woodshed to saw and 
split. He had done some low tone complaining about my pet sawbuck. 
Legs not splayed enough and it tipped easily from his Cheechako saw-
ing. I demonstrated that it was the sawyer and not the sawbuck at fault 
but secretly I had thought of improving it for a long time. The sawing 
end was the offender so we sawed the legs off flush and augured new 
holes giving the legs a wider stance. This lowered it six inches that was 
an improvement too. Much better he says and I must admit that it does 
stand more solid under heavy bucking.
Dick’s journals reveal a person thriving with his minimalist lifestyle. 
With his wit, skill and hand tools, he fashioned items he needed. When using 
those things he fashioned by hand, Dick was thinking of how he could improve 
what he had made. When items broke, wore out or needed some modification, 
Dick already had a solution in mind.
July 19, 1968:
Today was to be an extraordinary day although it started in the 
ordinary way … After hotcakes and small chores I canoed down to the 
cabin just in case I decided to go for poles. I decided to get the brackets 
for my kitchen counter mounted and my chair done and looking good. 
I was on the last counter bracket when I heard an unfamiliar sound. I 
listened and heard it again. Then I really came to life. The sound I heard 
could only be one thing – wolves howling. Again I heard that low deep 
howl and one higher in pitch. I took off up the trail towards my cabin 
log grove on the run and was halfway there before I thought of my cam-
era. I had run past it just outside the cabin door. The sound came from 
the hump I thought and from my stand in the grove I had a good view. 
I watched everywhere it was open and suddenly I saw two wolves in a 
easy lope coming down the trail off the hump and through the scattered 
small spruce and out of sight.
Suddenly the log cabin lost its flavor. After nearly fifty days of labor 
it just didn’t enter my mind that I could take a day off.

 July 20, 1968:
Today I would put my tabletop, counter top and counter lower shelf 
and also the shelf over the door together. I laid the boards across two 
planks smooth side down. Marked and augered holes in the edges of 
each. Inserted 1/2 inch plugs an inch and a quarter long into the holes of 
one and then drove the other with holes to take the plugs up tight. Each 
plug was coated with wood glue so this evening they are very solid.

Chapter 1
About noon here came Babe & Glen, Glen riding the pilots seat … 
I finished my gluing and straightened a gallon of 40-penny spikes Babe 
had brought. They were used he had told me. No matter I could make 
them straight. The other gallon was 16 penny.
July 22, 1968:
Today I would cut my glued together counter and shelves as well 
as the brackets to hold them. Put the door together and let it set until 
tomorrow. Put the legs on the table and fasten the hinges to the cabin. 
Now that I have nails I could nail on the roof poles for the woodshed. 
Put the tarpaper on and the poly. The wind was blowing a bit so I 
weighted it down and will finish it when it is calm. Soon be two months 
since I started on the cabin. A very interesting two months.
As I went by the guest cabin today I picked up my foam rubber mat-
tress and put it on the poles of my bunk. Four inches of rubber makes it 
solid comfort and it couldn’t fit the bunk better.
July 23, 1968:
Now the door I checked and rechecked my hinges to see that they 
were in line. I put the door in the opening and fastened the top and 
bottom hinge. Swings good but squeaks a bit – some soap will fix that. 
Now no. 2 & 3 hinge. Close together and they have to be on the money. 
No. 3 wasn’t quite good enough so I pried it off and planed on the 
seating surface a bit. Not quite enough so I gave it more. Give it a try 
so I daubed on some glue and nailed it fast. The door still worked well 
with all four hinges secure. Now I could leave it alone or cut it in two 
for a Dutch door that I had intended it to be. Cut her in two and see 
what happens. If I hadn’t been accu-
rate enough with my work it will look 
like a sloppy job except when closed. 
I pulled the pins – set it on edge and 
sawed it nearly through then put it 
back on and finished the cut. I swung 
it back and was real happy. It wasn’t 
perfect but very close. Plenty close for 
rural work. Now I had a Dutch door 
and a real cute looking door at that. 
With soap on the joints and pins it is 
entirely silent. Works just as nice as 
a door on a bank vault. Now I must 
devise a good latch – not buttons and 
hooks like a barn door.

it a good planing with the block plane very sharp. The same with the shelf 
under the counter. A few coats of varnish on those and the tabletop and 
they will look real nice. The layout is really taking shape now.
July 24, 1968: 
I paddled across to my pole patch and cut a load in a very short 
time. I was back by nine thirty. These poles would make the partition 
between the toilet and woodshed. Really straight they were a pleasure to 
use. Now, the mantle for over the fireplace. I had just the log picked out. 
Weathered a nice grey color. I fastened it to the wall with pegs so I can 
saw them off when I get ready to lay up the rock. Another day gone.
July 26, 1968:
A good morning to go across the lake to my pole patch. Where 
will this pole business end?… I could use a few to hold the moss on the 
woodshed. It sprinkled a few drops as I was getting ready to shove off. 
A nice crossing and as I climbed my well beaten path up through the 
timber I heard that familiar sound – the momentary beat of wings that 
spells spruce grouse … I found a good pole patch and cut more than I 
needed. Good straight poles are nice to have standing by … Back with 
my load by 8:45.

example of Dick’s amazing hand-eye 
coordination. The bearing surfaces 
are perpendicular to the swing of the

way around the pin. There are no 
low or high spots that would shorten 
their useful life. (Photo by Monroe

Now I need a window to keep the damp air out. I could cover the 
opening with a piece of plastic but I would like something clear like 
Handi Wrap. I would make a frame from 1" x 11/4" stock and then make 
a screen of it when the window comes. In summer the window could be 
taken out. This one I would make nine-pane if I can make it really rustic 
for pictures. I have the frame made and 1/2" x 1/2" sticks to divide the 
opening. Tomorrow will tell if it works.
July 27, 1968:
I put my 9-pane window together and planed both sides. Now to put 
the glass in. I would try masking tape and Handi Wrap. Being so very 
thin and flimsy I was afraid I might have difficulty. I was surprised – it

went on much easier than I expected and very clear to see through from 
the inside. The window really sets the cabin off and I think I shall hate 
to part with it.
Finding a commercially manufactured six-pane window and two smaller 
commercial windows in Weisser’s cabin, all fitting the window openings in 
Dick’s cabin, led me to think Dick was intending to use commercial windows 
but then decided to handcraft his own. 
Reading Dick’s journals I later learned the Carrithers brought the six-
pane window Dick ordered with them from Kodiak two months after Dick 
made his nine-pane window. Dick must have intended his handcrafted win-
dow frames made with Handi-Wrap as a temporary solution. Dick planned 
his window sizes, cut the openings and made the jambs for the recycled win-
dows he’d taken measurements on long before starting to build his cabin.

Window mullions.
In 2002 I had this steel grid made to 
match Dick’s mullions after a black 
bear broke through the window. (Photo

Chapter 1
The mullions for his nine-pane window started out being 1/2" x 1/2" stock 
that Dick sawed from a log. The Handi-Wrap (or later Mylar) was secured to 
both sides of this grid. Later Dick cut strips of spruce 1/2" by about 5/16" and 
sandwiched his plastic film between the two layers of mullion. This is how I 
found it in 2000.
Dick writes through the years about glass, Mylar, Handi-Wrap and silica 
gel. He left his cabin with Mylar windows. When the bear went through the 
nine-pane window in 2001, I was able to keep the outer frame but Dick’s 
mullions were destroyed. After replicating them and later having more bear 
damage, I replaced the Mylar with a single layer of glass, exterior to the mul-
lions. I then had a 1/2"-square steel grid welded to match the measurements 
of Dick’s mullions and screwed it in place. No longer can the window open on 
Dick’s gas-can hinges. 
It is difficult when, in the interest of safety and longevity to the cabin, I 
make changes that in any way lessen Dick’s presence for future visitors. But if 
I hadn’t replicated Dick’s window with the steel grid, other things in Dick’s 
cabin might be damaged by another bear getting through the window.
In replicating a frame for one of Dick’s smaller windows I was surprised 
to see Dick had handcrafted wire staples to hold the Mylar on both sides of 
the frame. He also taped the Mylar in place, which seemed like it would be 
enough without the staples. How could Dick even imagine handcrafting sta-
ples? I was at first resistant to making staples but I made one out of Dick’s 
copper-coated, high-tensile steel wire and it worked, so I made several dozen 
more. It was quite simple and did not take the time I expected.
Dick wrote about using wire like this from Jerre Wills’ cabin in the early 
years and later from a spool of electric fence wire Babe Alsworth brought him. 
This is the same wire Dick used on his bunkbed ladder, his cache ladder, his 
sled, a hanger for his mitten drier and dozens of other things.
July 28, 1968:
I like my window in the cabin. To open the door and go inside you 
feel warm as if there had been a fire.
I took a big cardboard box of about the right size. Cut it to the pitch 
of the roof – took a stick of charcoal and gave it the fireplace chimney 
effect and put it on the roof just to see how it would look. I was pleased 
with it and I know moss on the roof will improve it more. I cut more 
scrap cardboard and tacked it under the mantle then drew a fireplace 
on it. Looks real cozy. I made an ornament or two from driftwood that 
are especially nice I think. Nailed the molding in tight around my small 
window and plugged the cracks in the door with oakum. While I was at 
it I chinked the toilet end of the woodshed and packed some gravel to 
cover the floor – wall to wall, you can’t beat that.
Tomorrow among other things I will manufacture a latch for my door.
Dick moved his driftwood ornament between the fireplace mantle and 
the sill of his nine-pane window.

July 29, 1968:
Ten till six and I was ready to carve out a super door latch for my 
cabin door. For the latch I would use a wooden disk with a leg on one 
side to engage in a slot in the door casing. An inch and a half shaft 
through the center of the disk. The ends of the shaft squared to take the 
handles. Everything but the shaft of tough stump wood. A mortising 
job to get the disk in the door. Now I needed a lock. Any old housedog 
of a bear could push the handle down and open the door. I augered a 
7/8" hole through the door – a third of its diameter cutting a notch in 
the disk. A 7/8" shaft for the hole with half of its diameter cut away 
where it passes the disk. The ends of the shaft squared to take small 
handles – one inside and one out. Rotate the shaft to the point where 
the notch is next to the disk and the disk can rotate. Turn it a good 1/3 
turn to put the solid side of the shaft in the disk notch and it is locked.

Chapter 1
The lock handles are behind the door handles and must be raised to 
unlock. I would like some movies of a bear trying to figure it out but 
I suppose he would just wipe the door clean with one swipe of his big 
front foot … 
Perhaps the windstorm is over and Babe will bring my polyethylene. 
I hope so.
July 31, 1968:
Today would be the day to set up the stove and do more tin bending. 
I dug the stove out of the corner in the guest cabin [Hope’s cabin]. I nearly 
chickened out. It was the sorriest looking stove to have never been used 
that I ever saw. A half-inch gap along the sides under the top. One door 
hinge had come unstuck from the door. Oh well I had a lot of gear in the 
cabin and maybe I could give it a good smoking and maybe dry things 
out. I packed it down and put it on the stand. Put up the new stove pipe 
and made ready to light it off. First I packed a bucket of small rocks and 
put under the grate and then gravel to fill it to the grate. It would take 
a month and more to get ashes enough to hold a fire. I stuffed in some 
shavings and some chips and touched a match to it. Flames came out 
along the sides under the top and I thought this will never do. And then 
the smoke found the smoke stack and my troubles were over. It worked 
well and did a fine job of heating water. I was really surprised. Now to 
make it look right I needed a Chinese hat for on top the chimney so I 
got busy with tools and tin and had one on in short order.
Tomorrow is the big day. I will load all my stuff remaining in the 
main cabin in the canoe and paddle down to my new home. I would like 
a nice calm sea for the voyage. After lunch I brought a chunk of plastic 
from the guest cabin and made a tablecloth and a cover for the counter 
and the shelf under.
August 1, 1968:
The lake dead calm. A perfect day to move …
Clock wise around the cabin and set everything out that I want to 
go. Pack it down to the beach. Clean up the cabin and scrub the counter 
and shelf under and the woodwork of the stove stand. Everything in 
order. I loaded up and paddled down. Everything found its place and 
there was lots of room for everything. The cabin didn’t look cluttered as 
some do. An item or two to make. A knife holder for on the wall and 
on that project the worst accident of my cabin building career. The piece 
of wood I was working turned and I raked my thumb with the freshly 
sharpened ripsaw. The blood ran and I went down and stuck it in the 
lake and the lake was turning from green to red so I doped it, wrapped a 
rag around held by a piece of tape and went back to work.
Everything squared away and I saw it was two o’clock.
First night on my new bunk. I think that five inches of foam rubber

will make it just right. And too I can hear Hope Creek real plain. That 
will be a pleasant sound to go to sleep by. I packed my drinking water 
from Hope Creek and I think there is none better that I ever tasted. I 
must light the gas lantern this evening to see how it looks inside and 
from the outside.
Dick doesn’t make a big deal of this move but I will. It had been only 
slightly more than 10 weeks since Dick packed three loads of gear to his build-
ing site four miles along the still-frozen shore of Twin Lakes. 
Dick fabricated his own mallet, log scribe and many handles for other 
tools he would need. He sharpened his saws, axe and auger bits. He canoed to 
locations miles away and felled, peeled and rafted approximately 300 small 
trees to use as rafters, furniture legs, bed rails, woodshed/outhouse logs and 
more.
Dick had built his cabin! He had completed much of the furniture for his 
home. He had sawn lumber from spruce logs to make his own front door, and 
for door and window jambs. He had essentially built his home and what he 
needed inside with his own hands and now had moved in. 
He also finished building his woodshed/outhouse/storage structure, except 
for the sod on the roof.
In the 1977 video “One Man’s Alaska,” produced by the National Park 
Service, Dick said, “I worked 12 hours a day, six days a week and in 10 days’ 
time I had the heavy logs up.
“I think there is a lot of satisfaction in having everything that you made 
yourself. Even your door hinges and everything, cut’er out by hand with the 
tools you got. I moved in August first. There was still work to be done but it 
was livable.”

Chapter 1
Without background knowledge, if one were to overhear Dick say that, 
it would be natural to imagine a cabin thrown together without thought to 
masterful craftsmanship – but this was not what Dick built. Dick’s Dutch 
door is a masterpiece. His log work was not the finest log work being done 
in Alaska during that time but it was far beyond the log craft seen in all but 
a few bush cabins. To dawdle with perfection would imply elitism, a type of 
consumerism that was not Dick. He was a practical person. He wanted to 
build a finely crafted cabin, move in before winter and then get on with what 
would come next.
Dick wanted to build what he needed and maintain it, but not continue 
to build more and larger structures. One sees this throughout everything he 
made at Twin Lakes. 
August 2, 1968;
I heard a plane. Babe I’ll bet – sure enough the old T craft. He 
landed up at the main cabin and had things unloaded by the time I got 
there. When he learned I had moved he loads it up and taxied down. 
He brought packages from Jake & the Carrithers. Enough polyethylene 
to cover the whole area he said. Letters from everyone. Also he brought 
grapes, bananas, apples, lemons, rhubarb and candy.
Lots of mail … The best news today, Spike & Hope have consented 
to take the new stove and I could move the stove from the main cabin 
to mine. A couple more cuts to make on my 12 in. log and I paddled up 
and carried it out and took out some ashes before hauling it down. Out 
went that sorry looking monster rocks gravel and all in one trip. Some 
spikes in the top of my stand and the old reliable in place. She took off 
like a gut shot cat and it was as welcome as having ones wife return to 
full duty after a minor operation (I imagine). The biscuits puffed up just 
right and baked to a tan.
Now I can work full time again. More glue and the roof covering so 
that I can complete my heaven in the wilderness.
The new stove Dick wrote about was a beautiful stove Raymond 
Proenneke designed and sent as a gift to the Carrithers for their Twin Lakes 
cabin. Raymond sent it to their home in Kodiak. Knowing they were receiving 
a new stove, Spike and Hope gave Dick the stove in their cabin. So two days 
after Dick moved the “sorry stove” from the Carrithers’ guest cabin, he moved 
it back to that same cabin. That “sorry stove” remained in the guest cabin until 
2010 when the NPS replaced it with a newly built stove that was just as 
sorry. In 2018, the park had a simple stove fabricated from plans I designed as 
a hybrid between Raymond’s new stove and the old stove from the Carrithers’ 
main cabin. Ironically, it took nearly 50 years after Spike and Dick built the 
Carrithers’ guest cabin to have a stove fitting the cabin’s character.

A few minor details to take care of on the roof and then I put the

polyethylene on. Tucked the edges to get at least four thicknesses to 
tack through and fastened it down. I built a carrying rack for the moss. 
Built of small poles and about 2 feet x 3 feet. Sharpen up the round 
point shovel to cut the moss. I had a good moss bed picked out. Cut it in 
rectangles about 18" x 3 feet and eight inches thick. Two double decked 
on the rack made a good load. Once around the edge of the roof and 
it looked better already. Before it appeared that the windows were too 
close under the eaves but the thick roof fixes that.
Many early photographs show Dick’s rack for carrying moss being used as 
a mat beneath his Dutch door.
August 4, 1968:
I heard a plane. Not much noise and I took it to be Babe. It came in 
for a landing – the old Stinson and as it neared the shore and propeller 
stopped, out bounced Babe from his little door up forward … Coming 
back it got so dark I couldn’t see the gas gauge he said and the last time 
I saw it I didn’t have much gas. He had 20 gallons here so he would stay 
the night and gas up in the morning. He had some gas 7 or 8 cans down 
at dark lake we would go get them in the morning. So I would get a ride 
in the old Stinson.

Chapter 1
Big doors, big windows, room for 5-50 gallon barrels. She took off 
easy enough and coasted along at 75 mph … We loaded in three empty 
drums and some gas can boxes to bring back. Not much profit in that trip.
Supposed to rain tomorrow … Right then and there I decided to 
finish my roof today. I could finish it easy and more too so I went at it. 
Man I have cleared two acres of moss it seems and yet it isn’t covered …. 
I got all the moss in place. She is really looking up now. The roof 
helped more than any one thing to finish it off. Now for the poles to 
hold the moss. Four on a side looked better than three I figured. I would 
have to visit Lofstedt’s super pole patch for another 20 footer.
Now I had some fresh stuff that needed refrigeration. I had dug 
down a foot in the moss and found frost yesterday. Why not dig a hole 
and put a gas can box in and then use my moss carrying rack loaded 
with moss for a cover. That worked real well. I must visit old Frank Bells 
cabin and borrow his thermometer for a few days.
Dick knew the poles he used on top of the moss on his roof were not needed 
to hold the moss in place. The pitch of the roof is shallow and there is no ten-
dency for moss to slip. The cut pieces of moss grow together within a couple of 
weeks to form a single mat of sod that drapes across the ridge of the cabin. The 
sod hold-down pole frame adds a very pleasing effect to the sod roof. The sod 
roof fits perfectly with Dick’s ethic of using what is at hand. 
August 5, 1968: 
Today I would finish the roof on the woodshed. The 3' x 6' of 
polyethylene to finish out and then the moss and poles. The poles I had 
were too short so I paddled down below Farmer’s cabin and found three. 
Put the moss back on the roof that I had stripped off the ground when I 
started the project and many loads besides. Finally it was covered. I cut 
and notched the poles and put them on. She was complete and looked 
pretty nice. Worked till 1:30 to do it. After lunch a round of pictures. I 
think it will be the most photographed cabin in the wilderness. I needed 
one more 20' pole and only one place to find one and that was Lofstedt’s 
pole patch. I went by Frank Bells cabin for his thermometer which I 
will return. I am curious to know just how cold it is deep under the foot 
thick moss. My cooler box with moss on top indicates 42°.
While up the lake I visited the Tri-Pacer to see if he by chance 
might have some small bolts I could use. I found plenty of them. Cut 
three poles at Lofstedt’s. Two to make a long ladder for my meat tree.
August 6, 1968:
Today was the day for small details about the cabin. Window 
closing handles & latches – four hinges to make and put on. A ten by 
twelve inch shelf on the wall for my water bucket. Many wooden pegs to 
replace nails to hang things on. Then there were the poles to peel that I 
hauled in yesterday. I found three trees spaced about right.

Chapter 1
This morning I checked the thermometer in my cooler box under 
the moss. 40° it said. You can’t beat that. I’m sure it is lower than that 
out under the really deep moss.
The day was gone all to soon. I had many more things to do but I 
reckon I’ll get them done by the 15th and company comes.
August 7, 1968:
More small jobs today. Secure the poles on top the moss on the roof 
of the woodshed. It is rather steep and they might slip down a bit and that 
would be bad. Put the one remaining 20' pole on the cabin roof. Convert 
my three-legged stool to a four legger. Three legs are no good I nearly took 
a fall a time or two. Build a three shelf open rack for outside the door to 
set butter and blueberries and such away from the heat of the cabin.
I glued corrugated cardboard to my wooden placemats and they look 
real rustic and are certainly good insulation.
Tomorrow – build a small low bench for outside and clean up the 
place. Move all the scraps and leftovers that I have been working with 
to the woodshed. I am finishing up just right. A few days to look around 
and a few small jobs up at the main & guest cabin before company 
arrives. 
I was lucky to find Dick’s four-legged stool in 2015 after a black bear 
carried it 200 yards from the cabin after managing to open Dick’s Dutch door. 
I repaired the stool and sent it to the NPS archives after replicating it with 
three legs then cutting the single leg off and replacing it with two.
In 2015 a black bear got in the cabin through the door and 
carried Dick’s four-legged stool out of the cabin and ripped

the other two that replaced it. (Photo by Monroe Robinson)

August 9, 1968:
Today I would over haul the guest cabin and the main cabin. Get 
the empty gas cans and boxes out. Put that homely looking stove back 
in the corner and bury it with cans of nails of all sizes. Give the floor a 
dash of new gravel and it looks real nice. Now to make the big improve-
ment. Remove the stove stand from the main cabin. What a difference 
it made in the looks of things and much more room. The floor had three 
inches of gravel in places so I scraped it up and graveled the trail more 
than halfway to the guest cabin. A light coat of fresh gravel made it a 
neat looking job … Back to my work. I made new covers for the cooler 
cans at the main cabin. No more mice will be found in them I think.
Back at my cabin I attempted to raise the center of my stovetop. 
Being sagged as it is – it doesn’t heat water as it should. I did push it up 
some but not enough. A small screw jack would do the job in no time.
No more chips and saw dust will be made in front of the cabin. I 
scraped it up slick and clean and packed them down the beach. A new 
coat dressed it up proper. Also a light coat around the cabin.
August 12, 1968: 
I dressed up my floor after breakfast. Raked the coarse gravel and 
packed them out. A couple buckets of very uniform fine gravel from up 
the beach made it look first class.
Imagine having a gravel floor. This was common in wilderness cabins. 
Most cabin dwellers likely thought only of the advantage it offered in allowing 
everything falling on the floor to move downward out of sight. But this was 
not Dick. His journal reveals the attention he paid to the floor throughout his 
life at Twin Lakes.
August 13, 1968:
Today was a day to clean up my leftovers from the cabin. Saw 
them to length and split them for wood. A good pile of wood by the 
time I finished.
I drew up the plans for my fireplace and they look very satisfactory 
to me. Now I must try to figure out how much cement it will take. 
Yesterday I had sawed a few blocks of wood at both the main and guest 
cabin. Enough to last a day or two. Today I cleared the drift wood from 
the landing beach and picked up more big rock to make a beach a pilot 
would enjoy coming in to.
More small jobs – clean up the canoe paddle and give it a coat of 
shellac. Sharpen and oil the planes and chisels. Ready to return them to 
the main cabin.
Dick stacked the large rocks he removed from the beach to start a small 
jetty on the up-country side of the beach. The photo on the first page of chapter 
7 shows Dick’s rock-free beach after he and his brother Jake stacked rocks to

August 15, 1968: 
‘D’ day.
... Heard a plane and a twin engine at that. Sure enough a red & 
white widgeon coming up the lake. A circle over my cabin a turn down 
the lake and a landing. It looked nice ... They had made it. Spike, Hope 
& the beagle Missie had returned to Twin Lakes once more.

Starting from Scratch
Lots of gear and groceries. Lunch at my cabin. A fresh kettle of 
beans I had just cooked up. Much to talk about. Missie was very happy 
and ran circles around the cabin.
With Hope doing dishes Spike and I transported the gear and 
supplies to the main cabin. That new stove all wrapped and crated to 
carry like a suitcase weighing 105 lbs. Really a compact bundle. The 
workmanship looked as professional as the crating. It went together 
easily. Really a neat looking stove. We moved it in and hooked up the 
pipe – some sand in the bottom – some shavings and chips and a match. 
The proof of the stove is in the heating. It was amazing – very little fire 
but yet water kept boiling. That slightly convex top did the trick. I hope 
it never sags.
As I expected we are back to too much to eat and too many dishes 
to wash with Spike washing and me drying. We do appreciate Hope’s 
good cooking though.
Raymond told me he designed this stove and had it made in California. 
He designed it to knock down and then bolt together for easy shipping. It func-
tions superbly and is airtight. “Spike & Hope Carrithers, Kodiak” is etched 
along the top-front edge. Dick eventually moved this stove into his cabin, 
returning the other one back to the main cabin.

cabin. (Photo by Monroe Robinson)

Chapter 1
I would return Spike’s tools to the main cabin.
Spike worked at rebuilding Hope’s counter and shelf and I at bury-
ing a gas can box for a cooler box. Made a good cover from the lumber 
of the stove crate and loaded it with moss.
This cooler box at “the main cabin” (Spike’s cabin) rotted and I removed 
it in 2001. In its place we buried a 30-gallon garbage can with an insulated 
lid in the gravel floor of Spike’s cabin and another one in the guest cabin for 
summer caretakers’ refrigeration. Being indoors is not as effective as being 
buried under the moss in the shade of a large spruce, but it is away from bears.
Bears raided Dick’s cooler box, but not often. There are fewer brown bears 
at Twin Lakes today than during the years Dick lived there, however, there 
are many more black bears. The behavior of black bears would make Dick’s 
cooler box impractical today. 
Great effort is taken by NPS to keep Dick’s cabin original. The Carrithers’ 
cabins are recognized as historical but are considered in support of Dick’s cabin 
and a few changes were allowed to make them more livable for support staff.
August 17, 1968: 
Spike had brought me a quart of Varathane for my smooth wood 
work. Now was the time to put it on. It is a clear plastic finish and 
goes on very well and dries fast. I made good use of it and as a result 
the cabin looks much nicer this evening. The sun came out and a good 
breeze came up the lake this pm. I moved everything loose outside to 
hasten the drying.
August 21, 1968: 
There are many definitions of living but there is one that I have 
never heard and I think should be added. ‘Living is picking in a patch 
of very large blueberries after a summer rain.’ The leaves hanging heavy 
with water. It is one more little detail to make living in the wilderness 
worthwhile.
I … tried again to raise the top on my stove without much success. 
This time I used a bolt and nut with a sleeve. Put a block in the bottom. 
Stand the bolt on its head down. The nut ran all the way down on the 
threads. A sleeve slipped over the threads. Run the nut up pushing the 
sleeve against the top. My bolt 3/8" was too small. I’ll try something else.
August 22, 1968: 
This morning early I searched the flats [the flood plain of Hope Creek] 
for good flat stone to use in the 6" base of my fireplace. In my search I 
ran across the largest piece of white quartz that I know of. I would like 
it in front of my cabin so I lashed it on my pack board and packed it in. 
The same with the flat stones. Three or four good sized ones were a good 
load. Enough of that for today. I got rid of my load at Spike and Hope’s 
and after lunch I went back again. I filled it again and in no more than 
White quartz rock next to Dick’s cabin.

an hour’s time. These I brought to my cabin sorted and put in my cooler 
box. Time to spare so I packed in a couple more loads to hunt enough 
flat ones to build the complete fireplace.
Dick wanted this stone at the front of his cabin. Later he found two 
matching egg-shaped granite stones he called “grizzly eggs” to balance the two 
front corners of his cabin. The quartz rock was then moved to his rock collec-
tion along the side of his cabin.
August 23, 1968:
Another load of flat rocks on the way back.
I wanted to tackle that job of raising the stovetop again … That stove 
– I packed it out and took the bottom off – knocked out the rear half of 
the burned out grate and bent the rear end of the front part of the grate 
down to prevent ashes from plugging the opening. The sagged top – I 
set the stovetop side down on three chunks and picked myself a heavy 
ten-foot pole from my pole supply. I proceeded to give it a good stomping 
and it went. Now it had as much crown as it had sag but I am sure it will 
go back down if I get it really hot and shrink it or tap it down. Spike and 
Hope heard the racket and came down the beach packing flat rocks for 
my fireplace. They stayed awhile and we chewed the fat on this and that.
Suppertime again and too much to eat and to many dirty pots and 
pans as usual. Such is civilization when it comes to the wilderness.
August 29, 1968:
With Spike’s block plane I turned out some curtain rods for the new 
green burlap curtains Florence [Dick’s sister] had sent.
Florence’s curtains still frame Dick’s cabin windows.
September 3, 1968:
A good chance for me to get some work done. Unwrap the 6-pane 
window Spike had brought. Plane the G.I. paint off of one side and 
the varnish off of the other. Neither are compatible with the forest. 
I planed it down on the edge to fit the opening – trimmed up 
the putty a bit and give the glass a wash job. It is ready to put in 
when the time is right. I took my nine-pane window out and 
removed the Handi wrap. Spike had also brought some clear 
plastic made for covering storm windows. I had thought of cov-
ering both sides and making a thermopane but had only enough 
for one side. I would put Handi wrap on the inside. Light and 
delicate to handle and it required three strips to cover it. If it 
really gave the thermopane effect I would get more clear plastic and 
put it on the inside.

Chapter 1
September 5, 1968:
I would need a tub to mix mortar in and had been thinking of a 
50-gallon drum. Cut it in two with the wide Sears chisel Babe had given 
me. All the racket brought Spike & Hope down to see what was going 
on. The tub edge rolled and hammered flat we chewed the fat awhile.
September 7, 1968:
I paddled over to Lofstedt’s cabin to borrow his cement mixer (gar-
den hoe) and left a note that I doubt will be read before I have finished 
with and returned the hoe. Doing him a good deed I moved his boat up 
high and dry on the beach and leaned it up against the bank to keep the 
snow and ice from filling it this winter.
At camp I found Spike & Hope busy preparing to leave Twin Lakes. 
Their cabin has the largest inventory of any recreation site wilderness 
cabin in Alaska I think.
Dick’s journal entry above, along with the different hand tools one can 
see in photos and film of Dick’s time at Twin Lakes, lets us know Dick had 
far more hand tools than the few he packed in when Babe flew him in. This 
does not diminish his resourcefulness of creating a life with limited tools and 
having the creativity and drive to make most of what he needed with the tools 
at hand. 
I do not know which and how many of the tools seen in Dick’s film and 
photos were the ones he brought to Twin Lakes and which belonged to Spike and 
Hope Carrithers. The tools’ brands are not commonly seen at vintage tool dealers 
today and I wonder about their origins. I think the majority were Spike’s, either 
purchased at Sutliff’s Hardware or acquired from the U. S. Navy. Having access 
to Spike’s hand tools allowed Dick to bring fewer of his own.
A complement of stainless steel kitchen ware, all of the same style, can 
be found at Dick’s, Spike’s and Hope’s cabins, and at the NPS Lower Twin 
Lakes ranger cabin. Many have U. S. N. stamped into the handle.
September 8, 1968:
My two glass windows were thoroughly steamed over but the plastic 
thermopane – perfectly clear. I think we have something there.
September 9, 1968:
I was busy getting all my free groceries stored away when I heard 
another plane. This one would be a twin engine and sounded like a super 
widgeon. It came up country high over the mountains to the south. 
Satisfied he turned and let down. Another turn up the lake and he was 
on the water. I directed him in to my beach that was soft as the last 
one they came into. A new pilot with a foreign accent. He came from 
Germany he said. He asked if he could inspect my cabin and made quite 
a fuss over it. The nicest cabin he had ever seen he said. The cement – 
did he bring some? Yes, 6 sacks. We went to unload it. Any lime – no

lime. He said he had seen the slip and it read pick up 6 sacks of cement 
at Sutliff’s so someone loused up at Kodiak Airways but Norm knew 
what was to come but perhaps he wasn’t there when they picked it up.
Hope fixed some sandwiches of ram meat and they really hit the spot 
… I was alone once more. Time for action – the honeymoon was over. 
I launched the canoe and paddled up to the point. Squared things away 
a bit – cap the stovepipe, dump the water buckets and store them inside. 
Stack the chairs and gather up the tools to bring them down to my cabin.
First thing build a good gas can tub to pack rocks and mortar. I cut 
a can lengthwise a good six inches deep. Made a cradle of light poles 
with good handles. Set the tub in and nail it fast. A real sturdy rig. I 
marked my logs for cutting. I would let them extend into the fireplace 
two and one half inches. I started moving my rock pile up to the cabin. 
The colorful rocks lay out along the side where I could see them all. The 
rest in two piles one on each side of the fireplace location. I packed up 
three fourths of the pile and decided I would use them up before pack-
ing more or at least have some idea how they would come out. I exca-
vated for the base on the inside. Lots of rock no danger of it tipping in 
time. I plan to extend it six inches behind for better support. Six o’clock 
Twin Lakes time and I called it a day. 
Tomorrow will see the hole cut and some stone put in place. I am 
not sure how it will go not having the lime but I will give it a good try.
September 10, 1968: 
The lake was flat calm, a good morning to haul some sand. Up at 
the point was a good supply and two grades fine and coarse. I loaded 
my two gas can boxes, my new tub and two gas can buckets. Fog was 
starting to build up. As I neared the point I noticed tracks at the waters 
edge. Tracks of caribou going down – two cows and a calf. When I 
returned to my cabin I checked the beach. Sure enough they had passed 
and on down across the mouth of Hope Creek. I was surprised that 
they would pass the canoe laying on the beach. Four loads of sand and 
enough for a start.
I wouldn’t cut that hole to high until I found out how this rock 
laying is going to go. I took out the two bottom logs. Plenty room to lay 
the base. Took out some rock and dirt on the outside and I was ready for 
mortar. Three shovels of fine sand, two of coarse and one good shovel 
full of cement. Just about the right amount for mixing. Lucky that I 
went after Lofstedt’s hoe. I used all the rock I could get in 4 feet wide 
and 5 feet deep. About five inches thick. I used flat rock on that part of 
the base extending inside the cabin that is 22 inches. I used less than a 
sack of cement having enough left for at least two more batches.

new snow on the mountains. Dead calm again. A good time to haul more 
sand. I brought down three loads and decided that would do for a while.
I hesitated to take out more logs. Lets see how those rocks stack up. 
I could spend the day building on the outside. I am not overly happy 
with my cement. I have to screen it and then break up the hard lumps. 
It seems I have to use at least 1 part of cement to 31/2 parts pure sand 
to get a decent looking batch of mortar. I finished the sack I opened 
yesterday and not quite half of the second one today. A good 12 inches 
high and nine inches thick along the back which is four feet and then 
rounded off down to the base at the wall. At three thirty I stopped 
building and cleaned up the points around the rocks. I think it looks ok. 
If it only stands the test of time.
September 12, 1968:
Today was the day. Cut the other five logs out and let the sunshine 
in. I sawed the opening the full 48" wide and then made two splines 
(one for each side) from poles. Put a string of oakum down the center, 
cover it with a spline and drove a 20 penny through into the end of 
each log. That should hold her pretty good. The outside of the fireplace 
against the log ends and the spline embedded into the mortar… a 30 
inch opening, 24 inches at the back and 24" deep. 24 or 26 inches high 
will be the opening.
Today was a most beautiful day with big white clouds in a blue sky. 
I had to take time out for a few pictures of the scenery as well as my 
fireplace. I did pretty well today I think. This evening it stands 14 inches 
above the base all the way around. About another ten or 12 inches 
in front and I will be ready for the arch of the opening. I think I will 
replace the wood mantle with stone to get more length as well as width.
A clear sunset and just before it went behind the mountain. I 
paddled out on the lake and took a couple pictures of my cabin in the 
reflection from the lake. When the sun is low it is as if the cabin is being 
lighted by a very bright floodlight. I am anxious to get that fireplace 
chimney above the roof – then build a smoky fire and take a picture or 
two or three.
September 13, 1968: 
Such weather I have never seen. I left some water in my mixing tub 
last night and it had a covering of ice this morning. I would get a good 
start today. No sand to haul, logs to cut out or meat to cook. My ram 
stew is very good and I have enough left for a day or two. A big surprise 
first thing. I mixed a batch and was carrying a tub of mortar up the 
path. That momentary beat of wings. A spruce grouse flew up from in 
front of the cabin and lit in a tree just past my clothesline. I set the tub 
down and went to see the strange bird. A rooster – big as life and just as 
handsome. He was really decked out in his best colors.
 65
Starting from Scratch
I needed some rocks of a special shape so looked for some on the 
way down the creek and found just what I needed.
The fireplace stands 24 inches behind and 22 in front. Now I must 
build the arch over the opening and then on up to fill the opening. 
Nineteen inches to go and the hole will be plugged. Now I have a snug 
fitting arrangement of corrugated cardboard that I shut out the cold at 
night. Two sacks of cement used and a third gone from no. three. If five 
sacks gets me started up the chimney I will be happy.
September 14, 1968: 
Today was the day I would build the arch in my fireplace opening. I 
had given a lot of thought as to how this could be done wilderness style. 
I took one of the bigger log sections that I cut from the opening and 
cut off a 30-inch length (the width of the opening). Marked one side 
grid fashion. Lines one half inch between, lengthwise and lines 2" apart 
cross wise. Drove two nails one in the center on the top line and another 
eight inches towards the end on the second line. Hooked the blade at 
the handle of the one man crosscut under the outboard nail and over 
the center. Pulled the end down until it touched the bottom line at the 
end and made a pencil mark along the blade. A very nice curve. Then I 
moved the outboard nail to the other side and repeated the procedure. 
A three-inch arch in 30 inches. I roughed it to the line with my axe and 
then finished it with a jack plane. I flattened the ends on the under side 
to set on posts. These I cut from logs too. I set it in place and spiked the 
arch to the posts. Set it in position, braced and wedged it tight. Covered 
it with a piece of plastic. I had the stone ready and waiting. The center 
one light in color and four inches square. The rest rectangular. Mixed 
up some rich mortar and by eleven I had my face stones in place and 
also filled in behind to a width of 6 inches. Pretty happy with the way 
it turned out I decided to let it set the rest of the day and work on the 
backside. Starting to close in on all four sides to the throat and smoke 
shelf. Once past there the chimney should go at a rapid rate. Still have 
three sacks and a third of cement that should be plenty.
After supper I gathered more rocks of special shapes and sizes until 
it was too dark to see.
September 15, 1968:
Hotcakes and bacon to help me through a very busy day of mud 
and rock. I had no idea there are so many rocks in a small fireplace and 
about 75% of them don’t seem to fit until just the right situation turns 
up. One in particular I have tried a dozen times and today it fell into 
place as if it was made for the spot.
Another row of stones above the arch and filled in behind to make it 
a good six inches thick. Taking it slow on the front side to let it set. I am 
using a stronger mixture there too. Just about ready to start forming the 
66 
	
Chapter 1
smoke shelf and the sides are nearly pulled in to their required position 
before going straight up the chimney. Once I get to the point where I 
am going straight up again it shouldn’t take long. Three sacks of cement 
gone. One more should get me to the chimney. Building the fireplace 
has been just as interesting as building the cabin and will take about as 
long as the heavy log work on the cabin (10 days).
With the up lake wind and the temp. 38° it was real cool working 
bare handed and I didn’t think I could do the joints as well with my old 
rubber work gloves. My fingertips are worn thin and tender so I gave 
the old gloves a try and this evening my hands feel better because I did. 
I hope the lake calms as I will need more good sand from up at the 
point. Today I found the last half of the sack of cement not caked and it 
worked much better.
Soon just the man upstairs and I will be running this big country 
and I think the game will come back again.
This evening after supper I went searching for more special rocks and 
a bucket of water from Hope Creek that is very low. About as it was when 
I came last May 21. I thought I would just go up and inspect Marshall 
Farmer’s layout. 19 empty gas cans scattered here and about. The cabin 
area looks neater than ever before. No grub in the cooler hole. A new gar-
bage pit about five feet square and as many deep. If only they would burn 
their cardboard boxes and flatten the cans the pit would be big enough to 
last twenty years. The last pit nearly as big lasted only a couple.
September 16, 1968:
A box of very coarse beach gravel that was wet last night was frozen. 
When I went to mix my second batch of mortar I noticed a few stray 
gobs of concrete in the tub were frozen. The point protected the fireplace 
location and it was pleasant handling stones and mud.
First thing another course of rocks over the arch – then finish pull-
ing the hearth in to the required 18" x 5" before entering the chimney.
I tried something new that works very well. I packed in some coarse 
beach gravel and when filling between the inner and outer wall I trowel 
in as much gravel as it will stand and puddle it in with the trowel. I am 
now down to the required 18" for width and starting the smoke shelf. 
The front side is coming up to pass the smoke shelf five inches between 
the two.
One more course of stones inside will plug the opening. I used a 
few of my unusual rocks (packed in from all points of the compass) but 
for various reasons some just didn’t fit. One rock that I packed down 
Glacier Creek with the sheep meat has the honor of being the center 
stone above the arch. I had thought of going to a stone mantle but so far 
I haven’t located suitable stone for that purpose. I may insert some 31/2" 
pegs through the top course of stones and rip a heavy slab from a good 
log – plane the top and Varathane it as well as the face of the fireplace.
 67
Starting from Scratch
September 17, 1968:
The beach gravel next to the water was frozen hard as a rock. My 
rocks were frosty too so I took a stroll up the trail to the cabin timber. 
Snow halfway down the mts. and no game. I cut through the timber to 
the point. My fine sand supply was dry and I could use a load while the 
lake was calm. By the time I returned with the canoe a breeze was com-
ing down the lake. Things began to warm up so I mixed a batch. 
One course of rocks to reach the height of the opening and then I 
could pull the sides in. I was starting the straight sides of the chimney 
and the smoke shelf. Just about noon it started to snow a few flakes and 
it continued. As time went by the flakes increased in size and number 
until it was a real snow shower. After lunch it turned to rain and did 
a fair job of it. I still had the face of the fireplace to finish. I had made 
the pegs for the mantle while the frost was on. One last row with the 
pegs spaced right and mortared in. Then a row of small stuff to fill out 
the opening. All it needed now was the concrete stain removed. I wish I 
knew what they use. An acid of some sort I believe. Some mud left so I 
worked outside in the rain to use it up. Gathered my rocks together and 
sorta squared things away a bit and called it a day outside.
Now I could clean up the inside, pack out the surplus rocks and 
rake the floor. Put a 16d nail in the vise grips and use the head to rake 
the loose mortar out of the seams and scratch off that stuck to the rocks 
below when it fell. Took the braces and wedges away from the support 
under the arch. I was tempted to take it out as the first two seams above 
the arch were very hard but decided to leave it another day or until I get 
the chimney up.
September 18, 1968:
My little friend came this morning early as he usually does. 
Standard procedure used to be – fly to the ground or the cabin roof and 
then to my hand. Not any more. He just swoops down out of the tree 
and there he is tugging at the meat scrap.
Today I would finish the throat, the smoke shelf and start pulling 
the sides in to go between the ridge log and the purlin log. I made forms 
from gas can box lumber to get a more accurate job on both the throat 
and shelf. I also made the rear wall of the chimney 6" thick for a short 
distance to give more room behind the shelf. While I worked over the 
opening I could feel the warm air coming out. I feel sure it will work 
satisfactory. Fifty inches of chimney to build and it will be complete 
except for plastering the hearth.
Tomorrow I plan to build a collapsible form for use in building the 
chimney. Hinge it with gas can tin on the four sides so that I can buckle 
each side in for easy removal. Raise it up and use spacers to hold it in the 
rectangular position. It is a fast operation with a form on the inside to make 
a smooth surface that the man said is very important for good operation.

Chapter 1
My rock supply is holding up better than I expected. It looks as if I 
will have rocks to sell after I am finished.
September 19, 1968:
While it was warming up a bit I would build my fancy removable 
form requiring six panels and 18 hinges. Hinged on all four corners and 
in the center of both sides and both ends. Knock the sticks out that hold 
it expanded and it will contract enough so that it can be lifted out and 
raised for the next section. To bad there will only be two lifts to com-
plete the chimney. It was ten thirty before I got the fool thing completed 
and by then the fog was clearing and the sun finding the upper lake. 
Still I was in the process of pulling the big cavity behind the smoke 
shelf in to the 7" x 18" flue so I would just have to use form boards and 
gradually bring it to specifications. I was very warm working in the sun 
that finally had the whole sky to itself. The mountains were really beau-
tiful with the new snow and I had to waste some film.
By evening I had the chimney down to size and leveled off to take 
the form which when set on top just clears the roof on the under side. 
I still have considerable lumber and braces going up to the present 
level that should come out or I will have to burn them out. Even with 
my late start I hauled many rocks and lots of mud. Now with a five 
to one mix I am getting better mortar than I was at four to one using 
the caked cement. Now I am putting it through screen wire that helps 
considerable.
My bird came but I was busy getting things adjusted. The first thing 
I knew he was sitting on my shoulder, so I wound the timer, pressed the 
button and went for the meat scrap sack. I gave him a small chunk and 
he was gone for the day.
In the morning will be a good time to take the form material out of 
the area immediately over the hearth from below.
Everything cleaned up and the bean kettle on I just couldn’t put it 
off any longer. I got the Swede saw and sawed the posts from in under 
the arch support. Still it stuck so I tapped it with the hammer. It broke 
loose and there she was. Smooth as glass on the underside as I had cov-
ered the support with a piece of plastic.
Last fall from off shore in the canoe I could just see a cabin on this 
spot and in detail just how it would look. The fireplace has turned out 
the same – just as I pictured it. I can’t see where I could have improved 
on the appearance of it. Now if I can just get the cement stain off. Last 
evening I tried a little vinegar and it did more good than all my scrub-
bing with water.
September 20, 1968:
Now I was ready to build a chimney with no flares curves or what-
ever. First while it was frosty I would cut the notch in the rear overhang 
 69
Starting from Scratch
of the roof to let the chimney through. Cutting through my moss I 
found it still eight inches thick and nice and loose. Also I took the forms 
out in the region of the smoke shelf. If a smooth chimney is important 
I have it. And my form for the remainder I covered with plastic. The 
underside of the arch is as smooth as marble because I had covered the 
wood support.
This evening one more course of stones will put me to the purlin log. 
About two feet or possibly 30 inches to go depending on how it looks 
from the lake. One sack of cement left and a sack usually lasts two days. 
I will need another load of sand. If I remember correctly I have hauled 
eight loads.
September 21, 1968: 
I needed more sand so up to the point I went. Now I should have 
enough. Starting on my last sack of cement this morning first thing I 
wondered if it would do twenty-eight inches of chimney. I made real 
good progress and was really working at it. This evening I am just coming 
out on top of the roof with maybe twelve or fourteen inches to go. Had to 
slow down to cut flashings and now that is out of the way. By tomorrow 
evening I had better be done as the cement sacks will all be empty.
This morning I collapsed my chimney form – lifted it out and 
expanded it back to shape and set it on top for today’s work. It worked 
real nice and I am glad I took time to make it. With it acting as a chim-
ney to the roofline I wondered how the fireplace would draw so I put a 
piece of scrap tar paper in the hearth and touched it off. The smoke went 
up the chimney in fine shape even though the form had all the cross 
braces in it. When I am finished I will experiment with the throat – see 
how much I can close it off and still not smoke up the cabin.
September 22, 1968:
Possibly I would have had enough cement for one more course of 
rocks which would have been plenty but I wanted to save a little to fill in 
where the logs join the fireplace and perhaps paint the seams with pure 
cement. As it is it matches the cabin – low and wood’sy.
Well, the pressure is off – the fireplace is built and what little there 
is yet to do can be done regardless of weather except for extreme cold. 
Now there will be time to look around a bit and cut some wood now and 
then. A few days of curing for the fireplace and I will build a warming 
fire in the first fireplace at Twin Lakes. Clear and calm again this eve-
ning and now at nine the ground already has the feel of frost.
September 23, 1968: 
I went to work on my fireplace clean up. 21 tubs of rocks to return 
to the pile and as I handled them I found myself thinking now here is 
a good one and so is that. I had things cleaned up and raked in short

order. Time for a few pictures. The best view was from halfway up my 
long ladder leaning into a tree. Say! That fireplace makes the rear of the 
cabin as attractive as the front that I have favored in all my pictures. I 
cleaned up the seams of the last days work and washed it down. Looks 
pretty nice. Now the test for draft. I took a sprig of fireweed with the 
seeds ready to fly and shook it in front of the hearth opening. The seeds 
drifted slowly down then in and up the chimney. I could really study 
the flow of air by watching them. Some circulated over the smoke shelf 
before going on up. This will be a working fireplace I am sure. 
September 24, 1968: 
This morning I would cut some wood to build up my supply. This 
old business of all the time taking wood out of the savings bank and 
putting none back has been bothering me no end. In a couple hours it 
looked better.

making a liner from gas can tin to project down inside a bit. One gas can

would do it. I had it made and figured it needed a couple cross ties to make 
it more rigid and fit the inside of the chimney better. Right here is when it 
happened. I was cutting through a seam that is tough for the small snips. 
I was pushing and bearing down pretty good when it cut through and I 
cut my right thumb on the backside pretty good. I moved it so it didn’t go 
to deep but plenty deep enough. I tied it together with a couple band-aids 
and wrapped a rag around it and went back to my project.
Lucky that I didn’t have my good leather gloves on (they were laying 
on the bench beside me) or I would probably have cut them and they 
wouldn’t grow back as I hope my thumb will do. All put together and 
sprayed concrete grey. In a few minutes it was dry and I installed it. No 
harm in building just a small fire under a green chimney I figured so I 
got some shavings and started a fire. It was something to see the smoke 
go up and increase in speed as it passed through the throat. Some would 
circulate over the smoke shelf. Then it started to smoke a bit and I won-
dered why. I discovered that by having the cabin shut tight the air was 
going up the chimney faster than it was coming in. To open a window 
a bit or the top half of the door would correct the trouble. I’m not sure 
how long I should let the mortar cure before I built a good fire but think 
I will wait several days.
September 25, 1968:
I doctored my injured thumb. Washed it with soap and warm 
water. Put some mediquick and mentholatum on and a band-aid and 
then gauze to protect it and some masking tape to protect the gauze. I 
scrubbed the face of my fireplace and the slab in front. Not perfect yet 
but an improvement. I mixed a little mortar and filled in where the logs 
join the stone. That cement is sorry stuff. About half of the last gallon 
in the sack was caked and it took some rubbing to get it through screen 
wire and then a four to one mix looked like wet sand.
October 1, 1968:
A good day to manufacture a damper door for my fireplace. Nothing 
but gas cans, wire, nails and sheet metal screws but that should do it 
and it did. Copied after the working model Jake had sent and it works. 
Tonight was the night I would build the first warming fire but I hate to 
smoke up the hearth as I must work in there installing the custom made 
damper from L.A. when Babe brings it in. More odd jobs about the 
cabin. I built a tight fitting cover for the fireplace opening. It is the best 
storage space for vegetables and eggs in cold weather that I know of.
Dick accomplished what he set out to do. He was warm within his own 
home in the wilderness as winter set in, and he found the time to film, photo-
graph and journal his process. 
The fireplace smoked more than he would have liked. There are smoke 
stains on the mantle and rock above the opening. The chimney is too short and

Chapter 1
Dick did not wish to make it taller. Dick used the fireplace initially but less 
as time passed. At times he covered the fireplace opening and used it as a cool 
place to keep food. A visitor told us Dick had his National Geographic mag-
azines on a shelf inside his fireplace. However, one man said every time he 
visited Dick there was a fire in the fireplace. It seems Dick would often light 
a fire when visitors came and sometimes on special occasions Dick would have 
a fire for himself.
I am most impressed with Dick’s fireplace in the same way I think of his 
Dutch door. By building and installing four hinges on his door Dick made a 
commitment to saw his handcrafted door in two because anyone seeing this 
much smaller-than-average door with four relatively large hinges would 
judge something as not making sense. The small door, however, had a signifi-
cantly greater chance of operating smoothly without being cut into two very 
small doors, each hinged independently. Dick knew his craftsmanship would 
Dick’s stone fireplace reflects his sense 
of aesthetics inside and out. He likely 
looked forward to the warm glow 
of a fire during long winters as he 
contemplated its construction. Note 
the increasing masonry skill as he built 
upward. (Photo by Monroe Robinson)

Starting from Scratch
forever be examined and judged by everyone who visited for better or for 
worse. And he knew the success of his handcrafted Dutch door with spruce root 
hinges came with no guarantee.
Dick made a similar commitment when he started a rock fireplace that he 
had never constructed before. Not being a professional mason, his stonework 
is not the finest example of the masonry work being done at the time but it is 
done to a high level of craftsmanship. The shape of the fireplace inside and out 
beautifully complements Dick’s wilderness home. The uniformity of the rock 
size and the width of the grout lines speak of Dick’s aesthetic and his craft of 
laying the rock.
Dick had the willingness to risk the integrity of his cabin by cutting a hole 
in it, trusting he could successfully construct a stone fireplace he had only seen 
in his mind. Once started there would be no turning back and no one other 
than himself to rely on for support and advice. Again, there was no guarantee 
of success.
October 6, 1968:
After a time I came down from my look out and decided this was 
the day to return Lofstedt’s mortar mixing hoe. Worn bright from hoe-
ing concrete I oiled it to prevent rust.
April 29, 1969: 
A project in mind. I would clean up my big window and put the 
mylar on the inside. If my plan worked there would be no more fogged 
over window in the morning or anytime.
I think one of the great wonders of Twin Lakes is my tape that 
sticks on both sides. A strip of it around the opening and my little 
corner frame. Leave the backing paper on except across the top until the 
top was in place for once that mylar touches the tape it is stuck. It went 
on in good shape and a knife cut down the center of the standing leg of 
my frame formed the door to my eagle jell compartment [silica gel dehu-
midifier]. The jell in my oven on the stove drying out. 250° for 5 hrs. the 
instructions said. Not so long but pretty hot was my treatment. After it 
cooled a bit I tucked it in and closed the self sealing door. The window 
had fogged over as soon as I put the mylar on but with the jell in and 
sealed it started to clear and from the top down. Now at 7:45 just a few 
small spots along the lower side. I do believe that I have something.
May 31, 1969: 
The hinges on my door have been squawking so I pulled the pins 
and soaped the moving parts. A few licks with the plane on the bottom 
one to make it close better.
June 16, 1970: 
I went about my work of repairing my door lock. The latch disk I cut 
from a slab of spruce burl. A new handle for the lock shaft too.
74 
	
Chapter 1
June 17, 1970: 
Today I would assemble the door latch. A 3/8" dowel through disk 
and shaft, and glued in to boot. The handles glued on. Next time if ever 
it will require the full assembly. The camp robbers came but not hungry 
for a hand out with the half loaf of bread spiked on top the stump. The 
latch set up even better than before I think.
December 14, 1970: 
One last fire in the fireplace to warm it up and dry out the walls. I 
don’t use it as much as I should but a person enjoys a fireplace more if 
they have company. A paint job for the chimney cover. I don’t know why 
but I sawed up a couple lengths of wood. Probably some one will burn it 
and say “now, that was sure nice of that guy to saw it.”
October 14, 1974: 
A gentle breeze down the lake and the day warming. I had noticed 
the moss on my roof separating at the seams where I crowded it 
together. Not many places but a few and the polyethylene showing when 
you climbed to the roof and examined. I took my shovel and mortar 
packing tub to my roof moss supply center and proceeded to cut and 
place three loads of moss in the seams. Looks good now and will be a 
warmer roof when the cold comes.
September 9, 1980:
I looked at my bear damaged big window. I had enough Mylar to 
cover both the inside and outside but was thinking only of the outside. 
By the time I got the outside off I had talked myself into doing a first 
class job and do both sides. By now the sun was getting around and 
things would have to go right if I got it done by quitting time. I stripped 
the frame clean and cut my Mylar 261/2" x 30". Put it on with binding 
tape 3/4" wide. Both sides done I ran 2" adhesive cloth tape around the 
outside which left 1/2" extending over the edges. I slit the corners and 
covered the outer edge of the binding tape with the extending half-
inch. Sealed up tight and I’m thinking it will be a good thermopane 
and nearly frost free at 40 below. 5:30 when I was ready to clean up the 
mess and put my tools away. That window I was happy to get fixed for 
weather permitting there will be a bunch of tourists looking at it for my 
view down the lake.
November 6, 1981:
My storm windows did a good job during the few days of cold but 
one did better than the other. The good one was installed on the outside 
for the window hinges in. The other window hinges out so I put the 
storm window inside. The glass window outside was collecting frost. The 
visqueen not clear so I used “Glad Bags” slit down one side and across 
 75

the bottom. Spread out they just covered the frames so I taped them on 
and installed both from the outside. Looks good, admits more light and 
I can see out.
June 16, 1982: 
I would… take the corn knife along to cut some moss for the ends 
of the cabin roof. Make it look better at least.
June 4, 1984: 
I wasn’t completely satisfied with my new doorstop molding. It was 
better than the original but I could improve on it quite a bit. At the top 
the door has a curve – bows out in the center. I ripped a curved shim to 
glue to my straight molding. For other leaks I mixed saw dust and glue 
to a putty consistency and using a table knife I filled where needed. No 
light leaks when the door is closed now.
July 6, 1986: 
I took a look at my roof. I had watered it last evening after supper. 
It looked real good and if it stayed overcast it wouldn’t drink so much 
water today. Twelve buckets a day and hot days 18 buckets. The eaves 
would drip a bit but not a bucket full. That moss roof is like a huge 
sponge and evaporates water very rapidly on a real warm day. So, I 
watered it with 6 buckets of water.
September 21, 1987: 
No rain for a few days so I watered my roof both cabin and cache. 
The cache I can manage by sitting a bucket of water inside and with a 
stew pan throw some on top.
October 7, 1987: 
I raked my beach, and to bring rain, I watered my moss roofs.
July 24, 1990: 
Tempting the weather I watered my roofs one more time and how 
many times does that make this 1990 season?
During times with no rain, K. and I kept Dick’s sod roof green by throw-
ing 30 to 40 gallons of water up on it every other day during dry periods. 
We threw the water to keep from walking on the fragile sod. A profusion of 
blossoming fireweed, monkshood, chiming bell and yarrow, along with a mat 
of grass, greet visitors throughout the summer.
In a letter from Dick after his visit to Twin Lakes in 2000 he wrote, 
“My cabin roof of moss and fireweed looked nice for several years. I had a 
little smudge or two on the roof over the years – but nothing serious. I packed 
6 three-gallon buckets of lake water and sloshed water on it most every day 
during the fire season. Fire was never a problem.”

June 13, 1992: 
First thing I packed some aggregate to be screened on my pathways. 
Don’t you know a lot of people wish they had my fine stuff for pathways. 
Jay Hammond remarked about it one time.
August 19, 1992: 
Again blueberries and soapberries for me at lunch time. A welcome 
change. This afternoon a project I have been thinking about. A new 
refrigerator (cooler box.) Didn’t realize it would be so simple. Collapse 
the old one that has been in use for more than twenty years. With the 
old corn knife I shaved one side and one end of the hole slightly over 
size. All this after I had removed all the pieces of the old box. The 
replacement gas can box slipped in. A perfect fit. Now I was ready for 
another 20 years of service.
May 23, 1996: 
Many visitors who come have to examine the wooden door latch. 
It is getting worn and the wooden shaft for the handles have shrunk. It 
was getting pretty sloppy. I cut a strip of aluminum of the proper thick-
ness and 1/2 inch wide to make a bushing to enlarge the shaft diameter. 
Snugged it up good. 
There was some wear to the shaft of the door latch and also to the hinge 
pins during Dick’s time. By 2010, the hinges had enough wear that the door 
was hitting the jamb when it was being closed. Fixing this was my most 
nerve-wracking maintenance to Dick’s cabin. I wanted my work on the 
hinges to not only correct the problem but be invisible. Visitors admire and 
closely examine Dick’s Dutch door, with its spruce stump hinges and spruce 
burl latch, more than any other single thing. I had to get this re-build right 
the first time. 
Dick wrapped gas-can shims around parts of the pins to make the pins 
fit tighter. One of the gas-can shims had jammed one of the pins in place 
requiring me to make a screw press to remove it. I filed each pin and epoxied a 
gas-can shim around each one. I filed each hinge and epoxied a gas-can sleeve 
to line each hole. It is impossible to see that I have done anything.
A thin lubrication with grease keeps the hinges pivoting smoothly and 
will forever do so if kept lubricated every few years. I lubricated the flat cir-
cular surfaces of each hinge with unscented paraffin. Dick sometimes used soap 
to lubricate the hinges.
The Dutch door with its handcrafted hinges and latch creates a truly 
magical attraction to Dick’s wilderness home.

“I think there is a lot of satisfaction in having everything that 
you made yourself. Even your door hinges and everything, 
cut’er out by hand with the tools you got.”

2    A Land of Snow & Ice
“At two I woke up to hear the ice  
on a rampage. Like some one gone wild  
with a giant glass cutter. Now and again  
before the king size ripping sound  
it was as if some one dropped a  
huge bowling ball. It went on and on  
before stopping within a few minutes.”  
– Richard Proenneke
A visitor to Twin Lakes, Heidi Kaufman, summed up her impression of Dick 
Proenneke’s life saying, “he lived with purpose, a way of living not often seen 
in today’s world.” In winter, a different set of handcrafted items allowed Dick 
to travel and live with the same spirit of adventure, curiosity and purpose 
that his canoe and boots offered during the long days of summer. 
Dick came to Twin Lakes prepared, in experience and in mind, for the 
life he was stepping into. He came with simple hand tools looking forward 
to the challenge of making what he would need. While building his cabin in 
1968, he also was planning ahead for the season of snow and ice.
Dick made careful weather observations in his journal every morning and 
evening along with weather-related comments during the day. He included 
other events such as when Twin Lakes froze and when the ice went out. He 
compared present observations to previous years. To give the reader a sense of 
this, I have included Dick’s morning weather conditions in this chapter.
August 6, 1968:
A clear calm morning. Another nice day coming up.
Then there were the poles to peel that I hauled in yesterday. I … 
put two green spruce poles in traction to get the proper shape for sled 
runners in case I decide to build one.
October 12, 1968: 
Broken clouds and calm this evening – temp. 28°.
A day to start my sled. Take the runners out of the forms … plane 
them smooth on sides and bottom. Two more poles for the top rails and 
all I need are some 91/2" pegs to go between runner & rail and four 
between the rails plus some small poles lengthwise.
October 18, 1968: 
18° and fog – everything loaded with frost. 
A good day to work on my sled. Make the pegs, auger the holes in 
runners and rails and glue them together. It would be a bit over 71/2 feet 
long and 101/2 inches high, 2 feet wide. This snow is not much for sleds 
but the lakes would be just right.
October 20, 1968: 
Overcast, calm and 22°.
I would work on my sled … I cut, fitted and glued in the short 
braces to hold the runners rigid. Now for the deck poles. 
October 21, 1968: 
Overcast – a low ceiling, calm and 18°.
More work on my sled, cut the deck poles to length, notch them and 
a dab of glue under each one as I nailed them on.

Chapter 2
October 25, 1968:
Snowing, calm and 25°.
More work to do on my sled. Put the sides and handle bars on. No 
dog team but I may want to push it on the ice. Pretty lucky. I wanted it 
in the cabin for the glue to dry and had it been a quarter inch wider it 
wouldn’t have made it.
October 27, 1968:  
A few stars are showing. A light breeze coming up and 26°.
A day for small chores. I mixed up a batch of wood glue very thin 
and painted the runners on my sled. Tomorrow it will be ready to kick 
out the door. If I only had a pet caribou to pull it. Snow picking up – big 
flakes and lots of them.
Dick’s lightweight sled is held together with 48 mortise-and-tenon joints, 
a few nails and his thin copper-coated electric fence wire. He put the sled to use 
each winter, to haul firewood and occasionally meat from wildlife he found. 
Dick never used his sled to haul meat from an animal he shot because Dick 
stopped hunting after shooting a sheep the first year he lived at Twin Lakes. 
All of the meat he ate after that first winter was either given to him, salvaged 
from what hunters left from shooting a trophy animal or salvaged from wolf 
kills. The exception to this was Dick’s catching fish and occasionally killing a 
porcupine.

A Land of Snow & Ice
October 31, 1968: 
Overcast and again a strong wind down the lake. Temp. 30°.
I will need an ice chisel later on. No pipe for a handle but lots of 
spruce. I would use the large wide chisel Babe had given me. A three-
inch peeled spruce eight feet long for a handle. I augered a 5/8" hole 
51⁄ 2" deep in the big end. A half-inch slot cut into the top of the hole 
from the side. Cut the side out down to the hole so the chisel will lie in 
from the side. Saw a couple slots across the open side for wire bending 
and it was complete. In the mean time I had use for the chisel.
I would need a snow shovel. For this I had the 15 gal. oil drum in 
mind. Cut the ends out and split it down the side and 22" around split 
it again. Take some of the curve out for the lower one half to give it the 
proper contact with the ground. For a handle I will use two small spruce 
poles spaced six or eight inches with two crossbars for grips.
From the ends I could make some ice creepers for slick ice and a 
pair with cleats for climbing in the snow. A good rough surface for the 
creepers by driving the point of a spike through in seventeen places 
and the cleat strips of the oil drum metal 3⁄4 inch wide cut in two inch 
lengths – folded at the center and the ends laid out flat a half inch from 
the folded end. Seven of these fastened on with small sheet metal screws 
to the metal sole completed the job.
Dick used the same large, wide, Sears chisel Babe had given him to split 
boards for his door and window jambs prior to making his ice chisel.

December 1, 1968: 
Overcast and a stiff breeze down the lake, 24°. 
The wind during the night had swept the lake free of frost. I was up 
at 7:30 anxious to be on my way down to check on the calf moose [killed 
by wolves]. Some meat for my birds and animals if nothing else.
I tied on my ice creepers and headed down the ice pushing my sled. 
The farther I went the stronger the wind and it was blowing pretty good 
at the lower end. The long hair on the calf was drifted full of snow and I 
soon found that the meat was no good. I could pull hair by the handfuls 
and the carcass smelled pretty ripe. I would take the four quarters and 
the neck & head.
I loaded up and headed back. Quite some difference going against 
the wind instead of down wind. One gust pulled me to a stand still. 
Without my ice creepers I couldn’t have made it. 12:30 when I reached 
the cabin. The meat stowed in a half 50-gallon drum to freeze and the 
head hung in a tree for the birds. The magpies took command but there 
is plenty for all.
December 7, 1968: 
Clear, calm and a -38°.
I broke my ice chisel handle down near the chisel end and so this 
would be a day to rebuild it and dream up an improvement. Now I think 
that I have it. I augered a 5/8" hole about 5" deep in the end of the han-
dle. Then with the rip saw I split it up the center of the hole for about 
two feet – wedged the two halves apart at the end and mortised out a 
slot for the head on the chisel shank – mixed a batch of glue and saw 
These are the ice creepers I replicated 
from the end of a 15-gallon drum by 
following Dick’s journal entries to 
simulate Dick’s handcrafted creepers. 
Dick probably discarded his ice creepers 
after they developed more metal fatigue 
cracks than he was able to repair. Dick 
used rawhide stings rather than the 
leather strings seen here. (Photo by

later used a drawknife to shave the

on Page 98.
dust – coated the inside of the two halves and also the groove & slot for 
the chisel. I laid the chisel in and nailed the two halves together – sawed 
two slots around the end and put on two wire clamps. Give it a day or 
two to dry and see how it works.
December 14, 1968: 
Fog this morning, calm and a -6°. 
I took a walk down the lake to test an improvement on my ice 
creepers. They work much better now.
December 16, 1968: 
Overcast, a good breeze up the lake and 4°.
No day to travel – I would improve my snow shovel. Two 
metal brackets to stiffen the lower end and relocate and glue 
as well as nail the handles. A better shovel now I am sure.
Dick used metal brackets to stiffen his snow shovel handle.

behind his woodshed to replicate

June 6, 1969: 
Partly cloudy, a good breeze down and 40°.
Also the remainder of the 50-gallon drum I trimmed the edge and 
filed it smooth then corrugated the edge with the caulking iron – reduc-
ing the circumference by one inch. Enough that my mortar mixing tub 
will slip down over the top making a bear proof storage can.
The caulking iron (chinking tool) is the tool Dick chinked his cabin with 
in Chapter 1 (Page 19).
Dick kept an emergency cache of food stored in a 50-gallon storage drum, 
an insurance in the event his cabin burned when he was away. Dick’s sod roof 
came with this risk.
June 17, 1970: 
 … This would be a foul day.
Now to repair my snow shovel. A note in my visitors book dated 
4/1/70 signed by one Eugene Rosenquist of Kenai reads “Yesterday I 
borrowed your snow shovel to help shovel a run way for my plane after 
we were snowed in on the opposite side of the lake. Through carelessness 
and misuse I broke it. For this I am sorry because it is hand crafted and 
irreplaceable for this too I am sorry for I would like to do something to 
make it up. If I can be of any service to you in the future I am sincerely 
yours”. Such an offer because of a couple broken sticks. Quite a contrast

between him and the characters who broke my latch and burned my 
wood not to mention cluttering up the place.
After staying at Twin Lakes throughout the winter of 1968-69, Dick 
left his cabin during the winter months to stay with his aging parents in 
Primrose, Iowa, for the next several years. Then he stayed year-round at his 
cabin for many years. During the last years he resided at Twin Lakes, he 
would take breaks away from his cabin to take care of friend’s homes in Port 
Alsworth or he would visit his brother in California. 	
	
Dick typically answered a person’s question without hesitation. But when 
K. asked Dick how many years he lived at Twin Lakes full time, he hesitated 
for several minutes before saying, “between 17 and 19 years.”
August 22, 1970: 
Low fog and calm.
I would work on my snow shovel. I had been intending to cut new 
poles for the handles so that they might season a bit but never got near 
the pole patch. How about ripping a pole down the center. Use the two 
halves with flat sides in. Put the two hand grips in between. The greater 
width of the larger pole halves was much stiffer than a round pole. Jerre 
[Wills] was just telling me last night that Eugene Rosenquist (the guy 
who broke it) is a survey engineer and has a very, very brilliant mind. 
But not quite brilliant enough to think of replacing a snow shovel which 
he had broken through abuse & carelessness. Anyway it was getting 
repaired first class and he won’t be using it come the next snow.
Jerre Wills built a cabin at Whitefish point in 1968. It was on a five-acre 
piece of deeded property. 
October 31, 1970: 
Snowing still, calm and 20°.
I shoveled my trails and careful where I made tracks so as not to 
mess up the beautiful work of mother nature.
November 12, 1970: 
Overcast, a light breeze up and 18°.
I dug out my ice creepers and proceeded to improve their holding 
power. Eight small sheet metal screws through the metal sole from the 
inside for each of them. Plenty sharp and just right to rip pant legs and 
the boot on the other foot. Rawhide anchors through the metal eyes to 
get away from the tie strings wearing through. 
June 15, 1971: 
Overcast, breezing down and 42°.
The big old sow and the new cub. So, they came back to this side 
of the mt. Down the lake breeze, good light I would have to cross that 
miserable ice again. Bad enough two days ago. How would it be today?

Chapter 2
I got my junk together and headed across. The ice not too bad on 
this side. Not as good as last time and all the way it was weaker. The ice 
green near the far shore and that is no good. I walked straddle the stern 
of the canoe putting some of my weight on it. Slid into the water and 
was squared away on the beach in no time.
Enough of bears.
Now the miserable lake again. I had taken a plank along to carry 
me in moving the canoe out to stronger ice. Move it then the canoe 
then it again. The ice weaker now. About fifty feet out and I thought I 
had it made. My plank aboard and I started but only started, slowly I 
sank through above my knees. My arm over the bow of the canoe kept 
me from going deeper. I backed out and laid my plank again. Better ice 
now and I trudged across. At times I had to walk fast and light as I was 
sinking and the ice creaking continually. Then white ice and no sweat. 
On this side I straddle the stern and the ice sank under the canoe for the 
last ten feet. In open water again. This was the absolute final crossing on 
the ice this season. These last pictures were worth every bit of it but no 
more, I have plenty.
The risk taker in Dick Proenneke is certainly in charge here. Between the 
lines in this journal entry is Dick’s honed judgement on how to get the job 
done without breaking through.
May 31, 1972: 
… overcast and 33°.	
My wood log supply getting down. I knew of several dead trees up 
country from the Weisser cabin. I could bring them down the lake on 
the ice. I cut six and hauled four home. Took the sled out of storage to 
do it. The ice very rough and hard and gouged the runners severely.
June 4, 1972: 
Partly cloudy, calm & 34°. 
Write letters and do other odd jobs … My sled runners to plane 
smooth. What I need is two lengths of 1 inch x 70 inch 1/8 in. strap 
iron. That would make a good sled of it.
June 9, 1972: 
Hardly a cloud in the sky. Breezing down & 45°.
Return my sled to storage in Hopes cabin and pack back a good 
limb of driftwood.
May 28, 1973: 
Partly Cloudy & 37°.
I broke out at Jerre’s to find water bordering the ice. On up the beach 
to the bare knoll and water all the way. Farther up a stream had glaciated 
out on to the lake ice and I made it there but not for many more days. 
 87
A Land of Snow & Ice
Coming across I was surprised how much the ice had deteriorated in two 
days time. Many patches of candled ice on top and a few steps of squeaky 
stuff. Some good stiff and long skis would be the answer.
May 29, 1973: 
Partly Cloudy & 37°.
I decided that I would make a pair of skis and try them on the ice. I 
found a good stick in my wood supply. I ripped it down the center with the 
big one mans cross cut [Dick’s Sandvikens No. 241]. That cut would make 
the bottoms. I figured I would have to hew the topside with the axe. A lot 
of chopping and a pile of kindling chips. I tried sawing the second one and 
it came out real good. Sawed the turned up toes with the keyhole saw.

Chapter 2
June 8, 1973: 
Overcast & 35°. 
How safe was the ice? By now it was pushed up on the beach just 
past my rock pile. A chance to use my ice skis. No problem – I marched 
right out and packed the planks back with nary a squeak of the ice. I 
took the ice chisel out and punched a couple holes. 18 inches as near as 
I could tell. I slipped out of the skis and packed them back. I can see 
where it would seem a long way across the lake wearing them. Pretty 
much like wearing snowshoes on dry ground. And, I would need the 
canoe to get ashore on the other side any way – so – it wasn’t worth it. 
I’ll plane the bottoms smooth, varnish & wax them and use them on the 
snow covered lake some time.
September 21, 1974: 
Raining, Calm, & 44°.
I sliced four gas cans to make steel shoes for my skid runners. Fold 
gas can tin four thicknesses and flat, 11⁄ 2 inches wide. I will have a good 
sled for the lake ice.
September 22, 1974: 
Raining, Calm & 50°.
The rain slowed to a light drizzle and it was agreeable to work at my 
bench so I completed the remainder of my sled runner shoes. Now, an 
hour will put them on and I am ready to hit the winter trail.
October 14, 1974: 
Overcast, Light Breeze dn. & 31°.
And this fine dark day would also be the day to put the metal shoes 
on my sled runners. I pulled it out of storage at Hope’s cabin and packed 
it down. My 11⁄ 2" four ply gas can tin was perfect for the job. I had 
folded six strips and it took 2 and 3⁄4 strips for each runner. Many holes 
drilled with the hurdy gurdy hand drill and I nailed them on. Too much 
brush to use a sled other than on the creek flat or the lake but it will be 
good there. The sled completed and back under cover.
In June of 1972, Dick wrote that he wanted some strap steel to make 
runners for his sled because the ice was wearing into the sled’s runners. Now 
he had engineered durable shoes for the bottom of his sled’s spruce runners from 
material he had on hand. 
At some point, Dick ran a length of No. 12 copper wire down the center of 
the runner to help keep the sled running straight when the wind was blowing 
across his direction of travel.
When Dick departed Twin Lakes his sled was stored in Weisser’s cabin. 
One handle bar was so rotted that I replaced it, being careful to match both 
the taper and the curve. Before the sled was sent to the archives, I replicated 
it matching every pole and mortise-and-tenon joint. Replicating Dick’s 
 89
A Land of Snow & Ice
overlapping shingle-style gas-can runners and the wire securing a few of the 
joints, I marveled at his constructing such a lightweight sled that stood up to 
the rigors of hauling firewood on the lake ice through so many winters.
November 25, 1974: 
Overcast, Calm & 18°.
The sled came out of Hope’s cabin and made its first run down along 
shore. Those 11⁄ 2 inch runner shoes make it a better sled.
November 28, 1974: 
Overcast, Breeze dn. & 36°.
There was open water along the beach next to my water hole this 
morning and I was leery about going out at first but found it safe 
enough. I figured the lake ice none too strong and so would stay off of it.
Thanksgiving day and a day to celebrate. Get cleaned up and wash 
my sleeping bag liner and a couple pairs of pants plus a few small items.

Chapter 2
The weather was clearing – patches of blue overhead. It was like a 
day in May. Now, just suppose that Babe should try it on a Thanksgiving 
day. I wouldn’t know if the ice was good for the T craft. I would check 
that good ice off Carrithers point. With my ice measuring stick and 
chisel I went over the snowshoe trail to the point. The ice clear of snow 
or frost and very slippery. I walked off shore and heard no complaint so 
I kept going. Out 50-yards. I cut a small hole. Real close to 3-inches of 
good solid ice.
The ice seemed good enough for travel. I would celebrate by trav-
eling the ice on Thanksgiving day. From the woodshed my homemade 
ice creepers came out of hiding. Oil drum metal soles with short sheet 
metal screws going through from the topside. I had just put new bind-
ings on a short time ago. I lashed them on and with binoculars hanging 
from my neck I headed for Jerre’s point. Perfect traction with those extra 
sharp creepers but nothing under the heels, so I couldn’t really stretch 
out and go. Three fourths of the way over and the ice began to crack. Far 
enough and I glassed for sheep… I was glad that I was rough shod and 
a foot instead of paddling… It would be time to start my special dinner 
that would amount to an early supper.
It was a pretty good Twin Lakes meal and all done in daylight. The 
full moon was just getting a good start when I emptied the dishwater. 
I would just tie on my creepers and take a walk to settle my dinner. 
Against that warm breeze I headed for 1st point … To 1st point and not 
a crack from the ice. How long would it take to walk back. Twenty-five 
minutes is good time paddling. The breeze maybe seven miles per hour 
so it helped a bit. Twenty-five minutes exactly so it’s a toss up, walk or 
paddle, same difference. 6:30 when I came in the cabin and so ended my 
activities on Thanksgiving day 1974.
December 4, 1974: 
Overcast, Breeze dn. & 24°.
The wind was strong on the mountain and down the lake. I could 
see much bare ice down the main run of the lake and a sheet of snow 
moving close to the surface. I wondered if any sheep had come back to 
the face of the mountain so took the binoculars and headed across. The 
bare ice, I found to be very slick and wished for my rough ice creepers. 
Good on ice but I would have to stay clear of the scattered small drifts. 
Snow fills the creepers to the point where the spikes don’t protrude 
and they are worse than none … The dirt mound below the bear den 
entrance free of snow and I wonder how much of a snow plug hides him 
from the mild weather outside. The second den a mile up country is well 
drifted over – not a trace of it… I headed for Carrithers point. Getting 
dark by the time I reached my beach. Wearing my L.L. Bean shoe 
pacs and my snowshoe bindings adjusted for the Canadian Sorels so I 
switched foot gear and headed over to pack out the last three chunks 
[lengths of spruce for firewood] and sled them home.

A Land of Snow & Ice
December 5, 1974: 
Partly Cloudy, Blowing dn. & 31°.
The ice was nearly free of snow and had a very glassy dark blue 
color. I looked for sheep on the mountains but no sign. Today I would 
go down and up Emerson past the high falls for a look up the valley and 
the north slope of Falls Mountain I doubted that the sheep had gone 
down to the lower lake country.
Today I would take the sled to haul my gear. A load can be moved 
with less effort on slick ice. I parked the sled at the mouth of Emerson 
and buckled on the snowshoes. The weather just cool enough to keep the 
snow dry and perfect for travel.
I didn’t see a track crossing the creek flat as I headed for the falls. 
The wind had taken care of that. At the lower falls, off with the snow-
shoes for the crawl up around the rock ledge. The pool of the lower falls 
open but the falls something to see. Like looking through a curtain of 
rough glass at the falling water. I wonder how thick it is for water can be 
seen easily enough. At the bottom it flares out over the open water.
Today I tried my Japanese pack frame for tripods and snowshoes 
plus a small bag with film and camera gear. The camera and binoculars 
in the front pocket of my ammo pack sack.
It was only a minute and a big full curl ram appeared and bounded 
through the snow … He didn’t climb far before he settled down to feed.
The light had not been good enough to film the big ram and now 
it was failing still more. I headed down the creek hoping that the wind 
would die before I started up the lake. Still blowing a good wind as I 
lashed on my creepers. The sled I would tow and in the wind it weather 
cocked and slid at an angle off to the side. The creepers perfect – positive 
traction and really secure to my pacs. 3:45 at my beach. The temp. 34° 
and still a live coal to get my fire going.
December 7, 1974: 
(Pearl Harbor Day), Overcast, Calm & 12°.
I wanted to climb to the big pasture for a look around. Go over and 
look down on Emerson Creek. Circle to Falls mountain slope and take 
a close look at the bear den. See how many sheep were on the moun-
tain. A pretty good days work for the short days of Dec. and the snow I 
would have to contend with to get up to the snow swept area.
I wished that I had some mountain climbers crampons (ice creep-
ers with 2 inch spikes). Something to give positive traction on a steep 
snow covered slope. My climbers [here Dick is referring to his handcrafted 
cleats] not the best – enough snow packs under that they don’t reach solid 
footing. Last winter the varmints had stripped them of their raw hide 
bindings so I got them in and used some of Ketchum’s synthetic rope. It 
was 10:30 before I was ready to go. For stability on the slick ice I pushed 
the sled to the mouth of Falls Creek. Snowshoes on to break a trail to

rest rock at timberline. From there it would be slogging to the big rock 
face and then nearly snow free to the big pasture.
January 23, 1975: 
Overcast, Lt. Breeze up & 18°.
At last Twin Lakes was headed for the good days of winter. This 
morning found it a solid overcast but still that breeze up. Today I would 
take a little tour. Hotcakes out of the way and I discovered that my ice 
creepers needed repairs. The left one cracking and soon would be in two 
pieces. A few holes drilled and some king size staples shaped from Jerre’s 
good heavy wire and I soon had it ready to go. A trace of snow had 
fallen that makes slick ice super slick.
It is not known what happened to Dick’s ice creepers so there is no image 
of this repair to illustrate.
January 25, 1975: 
Overcast, Blowing dn. & 30°.
After breakfast and my chores done I would celebrate this fair day 
by cutting a load of wood. I had a good tall tree spotted and it wasn’t 
long until it was down, limbed, bucked and on the sled coming along 
the edge of that wind blown slick ice. On creepers I think that I could 
sled a thousand pounds easy enough once I got it broke loose.
January 28, 1975: 
Snowing! Calm & 28°. 
As it was getting light I got up and shined the flashlight out the 
door and then crawled back into my bunk. Boy! This can’t go on and on 
like this. It appeared that there might be six or eight inches of new stuff 
and it was still coming down.
After my spuds, bacon, egg and mush I shoveled out again. My 
walkways are deep trenches now and if a good wind comes and it had 
better – there will be shoveling to do.
April 1, 1975: 
Overcast, Blowing up & 6°.
Walk on top of it. Babe, I doubt that he owns a snow shovel and 
doubt that he ever shovels any snow. Climb over the top of those drifts 
until they go away. 
April 7, 1975: 
Overcast, Calm & 20°. 
I would cut wood. Cut and pack in the big dead tree I robbed the 
burl from. Leave no mutilated trees in the forest. On the sled, snow-
shoes, saw & axe and my long handled shovel to clear the snow for a 
low cut. On the way I learned that I should have marked my packed 
 93
A Land of Snow & Ice
trail on the lake with a few snow stakes. Snow and drifting had wiped it 
out. Time and again I went over the edge and had to alter course. Near 
the far shore, over the edge and I was knee deep. The tree a big one and 
disfigured with much pitch showing. It would make a hot fire. I was a 
little disappointed when the sawdust showed yellow and soft. It would 
be light and not the best but it would make some heat.
April 15, 1975: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & 34°.
Snowshoes would be water logged in two hours time. I thought of 
the wide skis I had made and never used. In Hope’s cabin I would drag 
them out. Bare wood I would have to seal them or they would get heavy. 
After a sandwich I snowshoed up for them. The snow very deep in front 
of the cabin and after coming out and buckling on my snowshoes I 
raised up and bumped my head severely on the end of a purlin log. Boy, 
that did hurt and tonight I have a black and blue head. On the skis, I 
smoothed the bottoms a bit with the block plane and gave them a coat 
of Flecto. Tomorrow I would give them a try.
May 14, 1975: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & 38°.
A portion of the lake visible and the high mountains in the back-
ground. I would go down and shoot it. Hopefully the sun would be out 
and there would be some blue sky. I took my sled. Loaded my home-
made skis and camera gear on and pushed it. No effort at all on the 
snow free ice. It would be a help in getting off of the ice. Use the skis if 
need be. Later it will be good. A life saver in case of a break through. 
Not good to be loaded down with a lot of gear that you can’t get out of 
and will lose if you do.
At this time of year Dick used his skis to cross the rotten ice along the shores 
where the ice melted first. Later in the spring, as the ice softened, Dick some-
times used his skis for long distances crossing the lake. He sometimes pushed his 
canoe across for support and to cross open water along the shore.
May 26, 1975:
Partly Cloudy, Blowing dn. & 38°.
Last evening as the light was failing I saw the old girl [brown bear] 
start the climb that means the day is done. The twins trailing along 
behind as if they were tired. She disappeared behind a hog back and I 
knew where to look for her this morning, but not too early.
The storm was not yet over. The wind still strong and it looked like 
light rain up Hope Creek. First thing I would put my sled in Hope’s cabin 
and take the canoe out of Spike’s. A simple chore when you know exactly 
the right moves to make. Today I would make many moves and getting the 
canoe out the only right ones. It came eight thirty and no bear.
94 
	
Chapter 2
I would drag the canoe and take my homemade skis along. If for 
nothing else they would be good for extra bearing surface along the 
edge of the ice when getting back onto it. I loaded my full pack in the 
canoe and wearing a life jacket I trudged over. The ice not white all of 
the way and that blue stuff was squeaky. Jerre’s little bite the worst and 
what would it be coming back out. My bears were busy and in a favor-
able spot. 
My favorite filming spot for bears had played tricks on me this day …
Now, I had the miserable lake to cross. From the mountain I could 
see the pattern of freeze up. I could see the floes of the first ice to form 
and they were white and then the ice that had filled in – it was blue. I 
had it mapped out how to travel the white ice as much as possible.
I borrowed four nails and a hammer from Jerre. I drove two nails 
through each ski just forward of my toes. Let them protrude about 3/4 
inch for traction for the wind was strong and I was towing the canoe. 
I got onto the ice using the skis as a reinforcing along the edge. Boy, 
it was spongy going for the first hundred yards. I doubt that I could 
have walked on it without the skis. A lot of bearing surface there and I 
believe I could walk on very rotten ice. Blue ice, white, a narrow neck 
of blue and then I pulled the skis off and trudged on across with no 
problem. A nice channel of open water along my beach and if Babe was 
in good form he could get in and out on floats.
May 31, 1975: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm, & 25°. 
The lake ice was bound to be good. I would take my homemade 
skis and look for a place to get out onto the thick ice. I figured the base 
of Crag mountain would be good. Much shadow from the mountain 
and no creek water feeding in. I trudged the beach in that direction. 
No problem, I found a good place just past the last bend of the beach of 
Carrithers point. A hundred feet off shore the ice squeaked with each 
step. Then a stretch of coarse textured ice and it was solid. I wonder 
what the difference is. Patches of white fine textured ice and spongy. The 
coarse texture more dark and solid. I was doing fine and saving about 
five and a half miles. Towards the far side, the ice not so good. More 
and louder squeaking and I made many detours looking for better ice. 
I didn’t want to use the skis unless really necessary. I knew they would 
make a noise and it being dead calm, the spooky one [brown bear cub] 
might very well decide that Emerson Creek is the place to be. A hun-
dred yards from shore I put the skis on. The bears were lying on snow at 
the base of a low rock ledge. When I finally reached the beach I checked 
again. The sow was up and climbing and I figured she had heard me. A 
little later she settled down to feed and traveled up country along the 
slope. The cubs doing the same. This would be footage of me watching 
the bears.

September 23, 1977: 
Partial High Overcast, Lt. Breeze dn. & 24 degrees.
Erv [Erv Terry] would be coming back for the meat. What could he 
bring for me. How about a pair of crampons (long strap on spikes for foot 
gear) used in mountain climbing on ice and crusted snow. He would try 
to round up a pair for me.
Erv Terry purchased Marshall Farmer’s cabin on the south side of Twin 
Lakes along with Jerre Wills’ cabin across the lake from Dick’s. Both of those 
parcels were deeded prior to Dick building his cabin. 
September 24, 1977: 
Partly cloudy, calm & 26 degrees.
On my table a brand new pair of chrome plated crampons complete 
with straps. No price tag and I wish he had left one so I could mail him 
the money. Each foot will have ten spikes 11/8" long. Good footing on a 
climb for sheep when the snow gets deep. Also the new propane reg-
ulator for his stove and refrigerator. Leaving it here so he would know 
where to find it, he [Erv] wrote.
October 26, 1977: 
The wind dying & warm.
I stumbled onto a G.I. fiberglass sled. Two-feet wide, three and 
one half feet long. A round nosed shovel shape with a ring and towrope 
under the bow. It had lain there for many years and had a good deposit 
of soil and leaves in it. Just what I need to tow my camera gear on the 
lake ice and especially in spring when the ice is very unpredictable. 
Break through with a good load fastened on my back and the wilderness 
has trapped the brush rat but good.
Below, I’ve inserted Dick’s journal entry from 1971, when he first found 
the sled. Dick’s 1977 journal entry above refers to the same sled.
June 21, 1971: 
The longest day and a beautiful day. Partly cloudy, calm and 40°.
On the way back something adrift in the shallow water. I got a hold 
of it and dragged it out. A small fiberglass toboggan with hardwood 
slats for running and a canvas cover to keep the load in place. Where 
had it come from?
October 27, 1977: 
Snowing, Breeze up & 20 degrees.
I had a good project for today. Get my new sled ready to go. At its 
best it had a load protection cover of canvas. The edges of it secured to 
the edges of the sled by bolts holding tie down rings and a plastic strip. 
Last night I had removed the fastening and put the bolts and nuts to soak 
in WD-40. This morning I wire brushed the sled and replaced the strip

and rings. A neat eye splice securing the tow rope to the ring. A bit of 
weld wood epoxy to mend a few bruises and it was stood by the fireplace 
to cure. Just perfect for size to carry my Japanese pack frame and camera 
pack bags. The best rig ever for a tour of the lakes after freeze up.
A visitor to Dick’s cabin told us that his battalion trained in Alaska with 
sleds like the G.I. sled Dick found, in the years following WWII. A patrol was 
several of these sleds, each pulled by four men. Each sled had a four-person

A Land of Snow & Ice
(Inset) Dick’s sled was constructed from 
UV resistant, UHMW (ultra high 
molecular weight) polyethylene to be flexible 
and durable in the most extreme Arctic 
environments. The runners are not wooden, 
rather they are made from a fibrous 
synthetic composite, and they are part of 
the original construction. The word “ahkio” 
originates from the traditional reindeer-
pulled sled from Lapland, Finland. (Photo

tent, a stove, food and other gear weighing up to 350 pounds. A mission 
would last up to 30 days. A canvas cover held everything in place. What Dick 
found was half of what had been about a 6' G.I. sled. This sled is sometimes 
called an ahkio. I remember seeing these fiberglass sleds for sale in surplus 
stores throughout the 1960s.
Both the G.I. sled and Dick’s handcrafted spruce sled worked on the fro-
zen surface of Twin Lakes but it was this fiberglass sled that became Dick’s 
workhorse on deep snow within the forest.

October 31, 1977: 
Fog, Calm & 10 degrees.
This morning I had another project in 
mind. Improve my ice chisel. Babe had given 
me a two-inch wide, eight inch long steel 
chisel shaped thusly.
I had ripped a spruce pole 3 inch in 
diameter up the center for two feet of its total 
length of six feet. Spread the split end so I could hollow it out to make 
a seat for the shank and head of the chisel and filled the cavity with the 
chisel in place. Put two wire clamps around the end and a few nails to 
close the ripped length. Good enough, but cutting a hole in four feet 
of ice isn’t easy. The walls of the hole keep crowding in until you have a 
two-inch hole and a 3-inch pole. I would slim it down to less than the 
size of the chisel. Where the blade would go the pole would go. So, I 
took the wire bands off and the nails out. Rested it horizontal on my 
sawbuck and used the drawknife on it. Small enough, I used the block 
plane. Mixed up more bedding glue and saw dust and after the messy 
job was done more wire clamps and nails. In an out of the way place to 
dry and I called it good.
November 1, 1977: 
Snowing, Calm, & 6 degrees.
No sign of the lynx cat and I would be happy to have him stay clear 
of my few rabbits.
My project for this morning would be to get my wood cutting saw 
in good shape. A big Swede bow saw with a very thin narrow blade. A 
very fast cutting saw if in good shape. Mine had started to cut to the 
right. Babe would say “swap ends and it will go the other way again”. 
That is true but shouldn’t be necessary. So – I took the blade from the 
frame, set the teeth to give it clearing in the cut and filed it until the 
teeth had a tending to stick to my hand when I rested it on them. Now, 
we would see and I took it to the woodshed. The cut was straight and 
fast. This afternoon I would take it up the Cowgill trail and finish buck-
ing my big tree.
Something I wanted to try – those new crampons that Erv Terry 
had brought in for me. Deep snow is much like walking in loose beach 
sand. Much churning under foot that is tiring as well as being slow. 
How would the long spikes work for other than climbing on packed 
snow or ice? A perfect fit on my Dago boots so I changed to them and 
strapped them on. I would climb part way up the hump for a view 
across to see if any moose had drawn brown lines on a map of white. I 
was surprised. Walking on crampons was very much like walking on 
snowshoes. Each foot a little heavier but each and every step a solid one. 
Going up the creek trail I went out on the ice. Perfect and I am anxious 
Ice chisel with pole shaved to less than 
the width of the blade. Dick added 
the third wire band at a later date.

to try them on the lake after freeze up. No more heavy falls on that Old 
Timer pocketknife in my left rear corner pocket. On a rocky trail, more 
tendency to turn an ankle but you can’t have everything. On the climb, 
very good and coming down the same.
A bowsaw blade typically gets a slight twist along its length as it dulls. 
Switching ends leaves the sawyer with the same twist, in the same direction. 
The twist is generally more accentuated at the handle end of the blade, and 
switching ends does help with the sawing, but only slightly and only for a 
short while. Dick’s solution of setting the teeth and sharpening the blade was 
the best solution.
The 42" bowsaw was usually the saw of choice for sawing firewood in 
this part of Alaska. Outside almost every old cabin hangs a 42" bowsaw. This 
bowsaw is heavier than shorter bowsaws. In my younger years I would watch 
old men buck firewood or “make wood” as they would say, never breaking 
a sweat. They made it look almost effortless choosing the big bowsaw over a 
heavy, noisy chain saw. Every stroke was relaxed and full length; the weight 
of the saw was the only downward pressure. It is easy to spot an inexperienced 
sawyer, by their exaggerated effort and then with the blade’s premature dull-
ing and twisting. 
The 42" blades have not been available for decades until recently and I 
wonder if it will become a saw of choice again. The blades on the market today 
are not as heavy-duty as the blades available during Dick’s time and I won-
der if they will twist and dull more quickly.
November 3, 1977: 
Partly cloudy, Lt. Breeze dn. & 14 degrees.
This afternoon called for a check on the lower lake. It should be near 
freeze up time for the shallow one. I would climb the Hope Creek trail 
along the gorge as if going up the creek. Climb to the top bench and then 
come across to Cowgill creek. There I could climb the mountain a short 
distance before hitting loose rock and see all the way to the lower end.
Again I was impressed with the crampons. Slow and steady, every 
step a solid one. I could climb to the top, no problem… The lower lake 
had ice in it and I was surprised how much.
Now, I will need creepers on my snowshoes to climb snow packed 
slopes that won’t carry me without them. Last winter I wrapped the 
side frames with quarter inch syn-
thetic line and they did pretty well. 
This time I would try to make some 
of heavy round gas can metal. Make 
one for each side (total of 4) and out 
of 1-inch wide strips 10 inches long 
shaped thusly. Lash them to the side 
frames with rawhide. Before I started supper I made one so I can study 
it during the night and maybe come up with an improvement.

Last night I studied the engineering on my creepers and decided 
the little grousers projecting 3/8" would not stand much ice or an occa-
sional rock. They would bend flat. I would beef them up – make inserts 
from the same material and epoxy them in place. Right away when my 
morning chores were done I went to work making the remaining three 
and inserts for all of them. When the 
job was done near noon they looked 
thusly and I thought, now how would 
the native have solved the problem of 
creepers. I think he would have used 
moose hide with the hair on. Use it 
like skins on skis. Cut the coarse bristly hair quarter length and have it 
sloping towards the tail of the snowshoe. Much lighter than my civi-
lized version.
November 5, 1977: 
Partly Cloudy, Very Lt. Breeze dn. & 1 degree.
My snowshoe creepers – to make them still better I would put a 
rivet in each end of the inserts 16 rivets in all.
I took my snowshoes down from above the fireplace. I had removed 
the bindings and varnished the snowshoes the spring following their last 
winter’s use. Ready to go except for replacing the bindings. A check to 
see how my creepers would work and I put them back to decorate the 
cabin until the snow slows me down without them.
I did not find the first snowshoe creepers Dick made.
November 12, 1977: 
Fog, Very Lt. Breeze up & 4 degrees.
A few other small chores and I would take a little tour. I wanted 
to see some winter’s white ptarmigan. I would climb the hump this 
trip. Other years I found some there. My feet would be sharpshod with 
Japanese pacs and crampons. The best combination. The crampons fit 
perfectly, can be buckled on tight without squeezing the pacs causing 
cold feet. Climbing I saw where porcupine had come and gone back to 
his stone house in Hope Creek gorge. One winter, years ago I had fol-
lowed his trail down over the side and at the end a stone house stronger 
than Fort Knox.
November 25, 1977: 
Clear, Calm, and 0 degrees.
For my trip across I would wear my Jap pacs and crampons. The 
ice too slippery unless pushing the sled or with creepers. I was dressed 
warm enough for zero weather and it was 2 degrees. On smooth clear ice

those crampons make a trail that could be followed from the air. A trail 
of chipped ice. A great vibration is set up by all their crunching and I do 
believe it helps to keep ones feet warm.
December 1, 1977: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm, and -10 degrees.
After my spuds I was tempted to go get my tree wood and loosen 
up my foot and ankle. I suspected I had sprained it by a miss step in the 
snow covered boulder bed of Dry Creek. Better that I should get a few 
letters answered and a few checks written in case Glen came. It seems 
that things go up in price between the time you order and the time 
it is filled. My second Exakta outfit up $6.20 and note, – pay at your 
convenience. My vibram yellow label soles for my Dago boots up from 
$5.00 to $6. and please send $1.00. I had written to Erv Terry asking 
the price of the crampons. Total cost $39.00 and would I please let them 
be an early Christmas gift? No way, and I paid him in full and a bit for 
interest wear and tear.
December 11, 1977: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm, & -24 degrees.
The sun still on the peaks and I wanted to see it leave so I took my 
sled axe and saw and went up around the point to blueberry country for a 
snag I had in mind. Not the best of wood but would make heat for a few 
nights. A sled load and I didn’t suffer from the cold while getting it. That 
little toboggan sled is a joy to use. Hauls a good load and pulls easy.
December 13, 1977: 
Clear, Calm, & -36 degrees.
I rummaged around on my storage shelf and came up with ski 
wax that Jake had sent up years ago. I wanted to try some on my G.I. 
toboggan sled. I had brought it inside for the night and now I turned it 
bottom up over the stove. Boy, that wax went on good. Rubbed it with a 
wad of paper and it really felt slick.
I took my sled and tools up the lakeshore. A nice dry, grey, no-bark 
tree and just a nice load. That waxed toboggan a joy to have tagging 
along behind. A time check at sunset to get my clock back on schedule. 
Only one more minute to lose in the next five days and then the eve-
nings will get longer.

My snowshoes I would take down from over the mantle and attach 
my patent creepers. I had thought of doing it with caribou rawhide. 
Soak it, wrap it tight and let it shrink. For now I would use L.L. Beans 
super tape that is very strong and bonds to stuff like no other.

My creepers were really messing up my snowshoes and I would have 
to do something about that. At the cabin I smoothed and rounded those 
sharp ends and edges, and will give them another chance.
January 26, 1978: 
Partly cloudy, Blowing dn. & 26 degrees.
My well packed snowshoe trail a joy to travel and I was soon on the 
high bench above the stone house of the porkypine. 
My snowshoes need crampons instead of creepers for the upper 1⁄ 2 
of the climb. I came sliding slowly down.
January 29, 1978: 
Partly Cloudy, Breeze dn. & 32 degrees.
Just for the exercise I would go across for a close look at the moun-
tain… This trip I would lash on my old homemade ice creepers with the 
sheet metal screw spikes. Real good for snow free ice but not so good for 
partial snow cover. The snow builds up on the bottom until the screws 
are hidden.
May 12, 1978: 
Partly Cloudy, Breeze dn. & 42 degrees.
The lake ice seemed safe enough but I wouldn’t get caught because 
I thought it was and it wasn’t. I went up to Hope’s cabin and dragged 
out the sled and my homemade skis. The sled is a good rig. I can haul 
my gear plus an eight foot 2 x 8" plank. Pushing it I can put some of my 
weight on the handlebars and it makes enough noise on the rough ice 
to kill the squeaking. Nothing makes you feel so alone as to be out over 
200 feet of water and have nothing to help carry your weight when you 
hit a soft spot.
May 21, 1978: 
Clear, Calm, & 25 degrees.
Dug a new pit for glass and metal and dug it in the brushy point this 
time. Sand and gravel and when the next flood comes it will be erased 
for all time. Put my little pumpkin seed sled and home made skis away 
in Hope’s cabin.

I sanded my well scuffled snowshoes and wish I had new center sec-
tion filling. An order to L.L. Bean for a pound of 3/8" neoprene filling 
went last mail.

A bit to eat and then another project. I would make a pair of cram-
pons for my snowshoes. Last winters metal grousers along the edge were 
too rough on the opposite snowshoe. These would be under the ball of 
my foot and well clear of the other shoe. I had a length of Piper aircraft 
square tubing. Tough stuff and yet easy enough to work with my simple 
tools. Cut two lengths six inches long and saw down one corner length 
wise. Unfold two corners to form a flat base and a 90-degree angle, 
3⁄4" high for the vertical side 
which would be the grouser. 
Completed it would appear 
thusly from the rear and laying 
on its back or base. And from 
the end … Some beefing up 
of the angles and they will be 
ready to attach.
November 6, 1978: 
Partly Cloudy, Blowing up & 14 degrees.
Today I would finish my snowshoe crampons so I opened the 
machine shop. I would complete one and then copy it with the second 
one that was now a blank. Beef it up was the idea. It wouldn’t be nec-
essary for snow but ice and a boulder under the surface would bend the 
aluminum when my weight came down. I cut another six-inch length 
from the square tube and then sawed it length wise down the center 
of opposite sides. That produced two shallow channels. Flatten one 
90-degree bend to make … The remaining 
angle would beef up the climbing grouser. 
Riveted in place it would be double thick-
ness where lots of strength is needed. To 
beef up the side thrust grousers I cut it to 
match their shape except to give the curves 
a longer radius which made it fit thusly and to make it stronger still I 
mixed epoxy and saw dust to fill the openings formed by riveting the 
unequal curves together.
December 15, 1978: 
Clear, Calm & -13 degrees.
In the wood shed I located a good piece of shoe top leather to make 
mounting pads for my snowshoe crampons. I could have used them on 
the slope above timberline today.

More green chunks came to the wood shed to be split fine, except 
for knots, for cooking fires. With a good bed of coals green wood is the 
best heat. That done I worked on my snowshoe crampons. I needed large 
flat head rivets to rivet them to the leather mounting. Roofing tacks 
have a very large head and the shank of good diameter. I made rivets – 
drilled and riveted until finished and the light failing.
For 17 summers a pair of something Dick made hung on a nail in his 
woodshed. Each summer many visitors removed them and asked what Dick 
used them for. Each item contained a section of old boot leather with a row 
of brass grommets for lacing. By the stretch in the un-grommeted side of the 
leather, one could see this was an item Dick used by lacing them around some-
thing, but what? I had contemplated their use a hundred times without success 
until Bob Wolfenden, from Montana, visited Dick’s cabin in 2016. When 
Bob suggested they had laced around the shaft of a walking stick it wasn’t the 
first time someone had suggested that, but the way he spoke turned a light on 
in my head. I asked him to follow me into Dick’s cabin and showed him how

they laced perfectly on to the tie-cord of rawhide that supports the weight of 
someone using the snowshoes. Stretches in the crampon’s leather matched every 
detail of fitting around the tie-cord.	
Bob wrote the following in the guest book kept on Dick’s desk: “Today I 
visited this wonderful place, a small item with leather, aluminum, tin and 
a shoelace sparked my curiosity. With a lot of help from Monroe we pieced 
together a use for the item. We determined they tie onto a snowshoe for walk-
ing on ice. My time with Monroe was as good as life gets!”
Bob’s and his wife, Janet’s, visit is one of the countless times visitors have 
contributed to a greater understanding of Dick’s life. Dick’s legacy includes 
these deeply meaningful collaborations between visitors and caretakers/inter-
preters at the site.

Christmas morning and it had the look of winter. Visibility was in 
short supply. It was snowing and the breeze up the lake. A non-flying 
early morning. Today this day of days I would treat with respect. Act 
as if it was Sunday – stay home for maybe the plane would come if the 
weather improved.
I wrote another letter while water was heating for a bath and laun-
dry. Some mending to do and I had learned that my snow shovel needed 
a minor repair. Epoxy and gas can tin is the salvation of Twin Lakes.
December 27, 1978: 
Partly Cloudy, Blowing dn. & 31 degrees.
Snow looked much like fog as it poured from peaks and ridges. A 
good down laker goes ripping up waterfall canyon and over the skyline 
of the big pasture. I was glad to see it warm. No good for snowshoes so 
I could read my mail and enjoy it. First I wanted to finish the repairs on 
my king size snow shovel. One pass with it makes a path wide enough 
for easy travel with my 10-inch wide snowshoes side by side. Often it is 
that I put them on in front of the cabin and shuffle out and away. My 
epoxied splice in spruce I wound with haywire and then another coat of 
epoxy. Put it to rest by the fireplace to cure. My Helen White goodies to 
store in a new round storage can … How can one hold fast to the brush 
rat image with such civilized treats?
“Bush rat” is an Alaskan term meaning someone who lives in the bush, 
wilderness or away from Alaska’s limited road system. Dick had his own take 
on the term and often referred to himself as a brush rat. He often called dwarf 
birch and willow shrubs growing along Twin Lakes “wire brush.”

or no. I hadn’t stood on the shore of the lower lake since freeze up. I 
was interested in seeing that ram that the boy at Jerre’s talked about. An 
early lunch and I lashed on my old home made ice creepers made from 
oil drum metal and spiked with sheet metal screws. Not as severe as 
crampons and plenty good for ice. 
I found the young ram maybe 50 feet from the lakeshore. Raven had 
opened him up, front, rear, and through the side. More than a half and I 
would say 5/8 curl would be real close. Come spring I will salvage the skull 
and horns. Dave the Warden must know about it first. I had had illegal 
game in my possession so many times that I am beginning to feel guilty.
I would try the return trip with out creepers but soon learned that it 
was no go. On slick ice and a strong gust I lost ground while leaning into 
the wind. On went the creepers and I trudged right along but slowly.
December 30, 1978: 
Overcast, Blowing dn. & 32 degrees.
This morning among other things I would rebuilt my ice creepers 
used yesterday. Cracking across at mid sole and caused by flexing. A 
hinge action in the sole would add considerable mileage so a few holes 
drilled on each side of the break and a few heavy wire staples to bridge 
it completed the job. Nylon lashing well worn from use were shortened 
and reattached.
Much dripping of the eaves during the past week and a build up 
of ice at the front right corner on my pathway to the woodshed. About 
eight inches of snow covered the end over hangs and the eaves. Jim 
Shakes splitter took care of the ice build up and my home made rake 
dragged the excess snow down to be shoveled aside.
The light failing but still too early for supper so I lashed on my 
rebuilt creepers and went for a test flight down the shore line to one mile 
rock. I encountered no over flow and with creepers it was good hiking 
except for the wind.
January 6, 1979: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & 21 degrees.
Gee! I was happy to see the winter shaping up a bit. Clear calm and 
cold is ideal.
Today I wanted to go up country and see how freeze up was pro-
gressing. I figured the big pool would be still open and so I took the 
Exakta, tripod and scope. First thing after my spuds, I over hauled my 
creepers. Some loose screws and a couple had lost out. A couple hinge 
staples to make and install. They worked much better on the way to 
Glacier Creek. How close to the edge of the lake ice could one safely 
go. At the upper end of the lower lake I have fished from the very edge 
along the open pool formed by the connecting stream.
Saving my new snowshoe crampons until I refill the center sections 
of my snowshoes. I needed some thing to help me on this climb. I had 
 107

been thinking, a stick of seasoned spruce a half or five-eights in diam-
eter tied across the bottom under my foot would do it. I cut them nine 
inches long and notched them for nylon cord ties. Tied on each end to 
my snowshoe binding straps where they loop down through on each side 
of my foot. Across I went on creepers and changed at the beach. More 
snow than last winter and solid. Very little trail breaking to do and the 
sticks held every step and even on the steepest part of the climb.

I could dig into that right hand snowshoe. A good morning to 
work outside in better light. The deeper I dug the greater the challenge 
became. If the left one was borderline the right one was impossible, but 
the impossible only takes a little longer to repair. Seems to me the weak 
point of snowshoes is the “toe cord” (L.L. Beans term for the cross bar of 
raw hide that the toe rests on and the binding attaches to.) Ones walk-
ing weight is on the toe cord with every step. After removing all of my 
previous reinforcements and damage to the original filling it looked in 
no shape to make a neat and lasting repair. I was tempted to use my big 
side cutters in a reckless manner and try some new neoprene. But! Then 
I would have a mismatched pair. I would give her a bloody try and see 
what happened. Again cutting to square up ends, holes to punch, slits to 
make and some rawhide to replace before I got to my nylon cord stage. It 
shaped up pretty good and by one o’clock I decided to start it to dry over 
Small ram horns on a stump out front. (Photo by Monroe Robinson)

the stove and have a stick of dynamite. Just as well put my new snowshoe 
crampons to use too. I doubt that they would hold as well as my 9-inch 
sticks cross wise on a very steep climb but they may hold better on a side 
traveled slope for the sticks became sled runners on the side hill. Installed 
and pronounced well done, I mixed some epoxy to coat the splices in the 
raw hide. Makes a real neat job and strong as all get out.
According to John Branson, who hiked with Dick many times, a “stick of 
dynamite” was peanut butter, slivers of raw onion and honey wrapped in a 
sourdough pancake. Other people told me Dick would sometimes put jam or 
leftovers, including beans, in his stick of dynamite. Sticks of dynamite were 
Dick’s standard fare for hiking.

I had climbed on to my snowshoes to give them a test at 22 degrees 
and the fresh snow covering… So the time is now for the sun to return 
to the lake.
To finish the day I sledded in three loads of wood from Spike’s back 
40. Perfect snow for sledding. An inch on the solid snow pack is just 
right. My snowshoes, I have never seen them better. Positive traction on 
a steep climb with the Piper crampons too. [By “Piper crampons,” Dick is 
telling us the aluminum he used to make them came from a Piper aircraft.] 
January 15, 1979: 
Partly Cloudy, Blowing dn. & 28 degrees.
I did small chores around camp while waiting to see what day light 
would bring. The peaks were in a thick haze of fog or snow. I wanted 
to cross and check out the far side for moose but I wasn’t anxious to 
fight the strong cross wind on the ice. I have been watching for moose 
at timberline and at the cottonwoods but no sign. The only way to get 
a true picture would be to snowshoe the timbered slope to Glacier 
Creek. I dressed for the blow and would be warm in the timber. My 
windbreaker Kelty over my quilted jacket and dress whites over every 
thing. Snowshoes on the pack frame I headed across. So much wind has 
eroded the ice. Crampon marks will disappear due to evaporation of the 
ice by the ceaseless wind. The original ice is polished and very slippery.
I did some minor repairs to my Sorels. Patched up my old ice creep-
ers again. They have seen more use this winter than all others combined.
January 16, 1979: 
Overcast, Calm, & 26 degrees.
I wondered how the caribou were doing … I would take a tour 
down and find out.
 My water supply in and stove banked for a few hours away I headed 
down the solid snow covered lake. Creepers would be no good because

of the snow. Crampons won’t fit my “Sorels” unless I adjusted them 
differently. Enough snow on ice makes it skid proof. I hadn’t gone far 
when I decided there wasn’t enough snow. Slick ice was slick ice hidden 
from view. But, I continued on. Now and again a wild gyration but no 
tumbles. Short steps and constantly on guard got me there in no bruised 
condition.
Dick was constantly repairing his gear, and he gave considerable thought 
as to what clothing and footgear would fit the conditions. Sometimes the right 
answer was not to be found.

My water hole plug working like a dream and I wonder who else in 
the north country has such a convenience. If only it was a metal bowl 
with a 11⁄ 2" metal tube 31⁄ 2 feet long welded on the bottom. Pour in a 
teakettle of hot water and lift the thing out. Dip your days supply with a 
stew pan and after emptying the bowl back into the tea kettle put it back 
in the hole and set a weight on top until it freezes in.
Dressed light for the climb. I was on my way.
I would climb Falls peak and it appeared to be a snow free climb. 
Some snow patches but few and hard as the road.
 In the lee of a hog back I picked a long, long snowfield going down. 
With out crampons I wouldn’t dare try it but sharp shod I would give 
her a go. Steep and if I tripped up I wouldn’t stop for hundreds of feet. 
Using my staff as a stabilizer I made short work of a few hundred feet. A 
jog to the left and I was on my trail to my snowshoes.
By golly Jake, they broke! He had beefed up my crampons [these are 
the crampons Erv Terry bought for Dick] at a weak point and now I dis-
covered that one had broken again, not at the weld but a short distance 
from it. The heat of welding had affected the nearby metal. On the 
mountain is a severe test, and especially climbing in the rocks. In the 
design, not enough provision for the flexing of the boot sole under a 
load. A good try and some thing learned by it. Next time will be for 
keeps.
January 28, 1979: 
Overcast, Lt. Breeze up & 20 degrees.
My crampons, I hate to be broke down. I might need them for a 
climb, so I looked thought and figured some more deciding how I might 
splint the break and feel that I was doing some good. I finally settled 
on a 1⁄4" rod from side to side bridging the break. Around and around 
I lashed it with super strong fiberglass packing tape and on the top of 
that L.L. Bean super tape and then a metal cover to keep the rocks from 
gnawing the wrapping. Best I can do with what I have to work with I 
think. One trip on the mountain will say if it was a waste of time.

Clear, Calm, & -44 degrees.
Breakfast out of the way I checked my sheep. I could see trails that 
indicated a few had crossed the big canyon and stopped on top of the big 
rock face directly across from Carrithers point. The tail enders were still 
up in the rocks above the old caved in bear den.
The temperature had climbed to a -28 degrees. I wanted to see what 
I could do at filming on the mountain … My Air Force mukluks with 
my home made crampons [what he often called “cleats”] that I haven’t used 
in years. The mukluks too large for the sharp shod crampons. Loaded 
for bear, I headed across. Snowshoes for the climb and at timberline I 
decorated a bush with clothes. It was down right warm on the moun-
tain. Hands too warm in the L.L. Bean super warm wool mittens. To 
the end of my snowshoe trail and I tied on the crampons. They were 
made for climbing and not side hill travel. I continued on up into the 
big canyon traveling that steep field of snowballs that had come down 
before the cold. Like boulders now and good climbing. Finally I would 
have to climb out on the up countryside and continue on up the edge 
on heavy drifts. Under the loose snow the crust was hard, so hard that 
I couldn’t travel the side slope. Too hard to kick steps with my canvas 
and rubber mukluks. I floundered around and ended up losing ground. I 
should have chanced my dago hikers in the cold and used the spikes. No 
go – so I slithered across the steep canyon slope towards the other side. I 
could see the sheep from there but it was a longer shot than I wanted … 
A nice big ram stood front feet high on a rocky point and looked down 
at the foolish one who would attempt to climb the mountain without the 
big rams sure footedness.
Falls and Allen Mountains are 4,790' and 5,280' elevation, respect-
fully. Even though Dick was frequently not climbing to the summits, from 
the 2,000' elevation of Twin Lakes he is traveling in steep and treacherous 
conditions after making the one mile lake crossing on his handcrafted creepers. 
Dick sometimes made this climb multiple times each week through parts of the 
winter to film Dall sheep or brown bears for the National Park Service, and 
to get exercise. He would typically take creepers for the lake crossing, snow-
shoes with various traction devises to climb the first 300 or 400 feet through 
the spruce forest to the timber line. From there he would change again to his 
handcrafted cleats or commercially made crampons with their longer spikes. 
Dick’s winter travel gear was subject to daily hard use. His life was dif-
ferent from people leaving their home for a weekend of winter fun and it was 
even different from people living away from town in snow country where 
they go about their life taking a snow machine to cut firewood or go to the 
store. Dick’s climbing mountains, crossing avalanche shoots and his reliance 
on his feet rather than a snow machine – and at his recorded temperatures – 
takes a stretch to imagine. This is Dick living with “purpose,” not just a person 
with nothing better to do with his time. Dick focused on having everything 
 111
A Land of Snow & Ice
taken care of at home – his food, water, firewood, and writing – so he could 
make these hikes to observe and film wildlife.
Visitors to Dick’s cabin are drawn to many different aspects of his life. 
To take a close look at his handcrafted life means not giving much space to 
his relationship to wildlife and wilderness, or his photography and filming – 
those motivations that drew him to travel many miles beyond his cabin almost 
on a daily basis. I do not think of Dick’s outings as recreation. Observing and 
filming wildlife was part of his living with purpose.
February 5, 1979: 
Clear, Calm, & -40 degrees.
Today I would have another go at the mountain and this time I 
would be sharp shod for that iron hard snow pack. I wondered how my 
dago boots would stand the -35 degrees which is cold for leather shoes 
and close fitting shoes at that.
I had an early stack of dynamite and headed across … I stopped to 
shuck some duds. Trade the L.L. Bean hot mitts for monkey face gloves. 
High up and the end of the snowshoe trail I poked the shoes in the 
snow and strapped on the crampons. Onward and upward to where I 
had stopped to film yesterday and then climb out and head down coun-
try along the slope. Good going, every step was a step forward. A lot of 
snow on the mountain and hard pack. I’m surprised that the sheep get as 
much feed as they do.
A following breeze and the snow very noisy. I was afraid that big 
guy would hear me coming and wind me too … He was there alright 
and feeding.
I was ready when that big one appeared followed by the 3/4 or near 
that, I was too busy to measure … They climbed up the rock face and I 
should have some nice footage ….
The trail hard enough that I didn’t switch to snowshoes. It was cold 
enough. Those neoprene rubber and nylon crampon straps were very stiff 
from the cold when I took the crampons off. 
My wood supply in the box I called it the end of a pretty good day. 
I was surprised at how easy it was to travel the mountain slope. Those 
crampons, I wouldn’t take quite a bit for them.
March 23, 1979: 
Partly Cloudy, Lt. Breeze up & 25 degrees.
Today, if the lake was agreeable, I wanted to go down country. At 
this time in March there might be caribou along the base of Black Mt. 
next to the lower lake. What to wear for traction on the new ice. My old 
creepers would build up with snow and slush and be useless. Crampons 
too severe. They would go through the new ice. I settled for my old 
home made climbing crampons with the half-inch grousers. A few short 
runs out on the ice to check things out. A nice day with the sun in and 
out … My heavy Dago hikers for the trip. The lake not the best but I 
112 
	
Chapter 2
would manage. Ice on the new water and slush under the many snow 
patches. A build up of snow under my feet and then slick ice. Whack 
them a lick with my walking stick each time I went from snow to ice.
April 3, 1979: 
Overcast, (Raining), Calm, & 30 degrees.
I let up on my letters and packed my broken crampons for mailing 
to the Lynwood welder. [The Lynwood welder refers to Dick’s brother, 
Raymond “Jake” Proenneke, who was living in Lynwood, California, at  
the time.]
April 9, 1979: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm, & 16 degrees.
The lake ice looked slick so I lashed on my old ice creepers. This trip 
would see them worn to destruction. Oil drum metal will only stand so 
much flexing.
This was the last time Dick journals of using his sheet-metal-screw ice 
creepers. By repairing them when needed, Dick’s handcrafted ice creepers 
withstood many winters of severe use. 
April 14, 1979: 
Clear, Calm, & 0 degree.
A lot of nice rams coming 3⁄4 curl now to get near them I would 
have to climb on snow all the way and it wouldn’t be easy with my 
crampons on their way to the welder.
April 16, 1979: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm, & 6 degrees.
Directly across from Carrithers point at the base of the big rock face 
four sheep. One up in rocks of the face and I knew that he was wise to 
the first green grass that grows there. Not the greatest rams but I could 
do some good if I climbed the big open wash up country and came along 
the mountainside to look down on them when they climbed out.
No good, better I should come back but the day had only started 
and I hated to miss a chance. I would follow the shoreline down country 
and see how things appeared from there. I chose to stay on the snow 
pack of the lakeshore to avoid the solid white. Good going but by now 
it was flat light due to a solid grey overcast. I came to a glaciated area 
that had a good build up of ice at shoreline. There would be a good spot 
to get off of the ice when break up is near and a border of water along 
shore. I marked that spot in the back of my head and then it happened. 
Both feet kicked out towards the lake and I came down with a terri-
ble thud on my right side. Evidently my right arm was at my side with 
elbow bent. Unfortunately, I didn’t hit my very durable head. My arm 
and my lower ribs hurt so bad I could hardly get my breath. I managed 
 113
A Land of Snow & Ice
to get out of my pack and lay there moaning and groaning and gasping 
for breath. This just had to be the worst ever on ice. The day on that side 
of the lake was finished I was sure of that. How long it would be before 
I felt no pain I had no idea. After a few minutes on the ice I decided 
the thing to do was head for the barn and I figured it would be a long 
trip for it looked like a long ways to Carrithers point. With great effort 
I managed to get to my feet and the next big chore was to get under my 
pack again. It had contributed a lot to my striking force. I looked to see 
what had dropped me and found a little patch of sloping ice covered by 
a dusting of snow. My Dago hikers had snow on the soles and between 
the two it was too much.
Slowly I made my way across and the cabin looked mighty good. If 
this had happened at the lower end or the upper with tough going and 
40 below I would have earned my right to be here.
Right away I took a couple aspirin and set down by the stove to rest 
awhile. My arm was paining pretty good on the inside but not out. My 
ribs had no point of source pain indicating a broken rib. Just very sore 
and much spasms made any movement a stab of pain.
I would lie down awhile something I hadn’t done during the day 
for a very long time. The upper bunk was mine so I climbed the ladder 
and slowly rolled in. It was about 9:30 [a.m.] and I rested till near twelve 
and may have dozed a bit. When I decided to get up it reminded me of 
my hernia surgery and trying to sit up in bed without aid. After a few 
tries I managed to roll over and down the ladder. I put one of my big 
gas can tubs on the stove and emptied the teakettle. Hot towels between 
my rib cage and arm for an hour helped my arm considerable but the 
spasms were still there. Somewhere I had two or more elastic bandages 
but could only come up with one small one. On the shelf over the door 
two chocolate mix cans containing first aid supplies left by Navy doctors 
who hunted from Lofstedt’s cabin years back. They had come equipped 
to perform surgery if necessary. In one can a small bandage and in the 
other a big body bandage. Brand new and in plastic. I unrolled that dude 
good and snug around my rib cage. That helped a little but only a little. 
Moving like 95 years old I could manage after a fashion. Boy I was glad 
that I had my woodpile rounded out. Without it I would be sawing 
blocks short enough to go through the stove door vertically.
Better I should get another bucket of water just in case tomorrow 
ruled it out. A bucket of water and a load of wood or two was a project.
The weather was thickening down country and before long snow 
came. My arm not doing too bad and maybe I could write a couple let-
ters. Sitting still was fine but boy that moving after a period of inactiv-
ity. I managed and come suppertime had my carry boo and beans. Good 
Sara [Hornburger] bread and she complained of her bread not being 
good. The purtiest loaf of bread I have seen in years and I’m thinking 
Sara knew it.

Supper was early and now at 7:30 sitting quietly writing I’m not 
hurt’n but to cough would be like falling on my dagger.
Today’s escapade reminds me of what I once knew. “Shoulder to 
shoulder we have fought it out, yet the wild must win in the end,” but 
not today. Robert Service.
The two “chocolate mix cans” with first-aid supplies still sit on the shelf 
over Dick’s door. Dick left tin coffee cans with snug-fitting metal tops labeled 
“first aid” in Hope’s, Spike’s and Weisser’s cabins, each full of supplies.
April 17, 1979: 
Overcast, Blowing dn. & 28 degrees.
Didn’t sleep too much and while I was laying listening to the wind 
in the spruce it came to me loud and clear. It was my hiking staff that 
had caused so much pain to my inner arm and rib cage. I was packing it 
under my arm shotgun carrying fashion. Rolling out this morning was 
a study in slow motion. Muscle spasms like you wouldn’t believe … I 
took two Excedrin and climbed to my bunk to stay till six. The pills had 
knocked the sharp edge off and I did pretty well at getting my breakfast 
and packing wood and water.
The tub on the stove for another session of hot towels and this time 
it was two hours and as hot as I could stand. So hot so long that I was 
feeling warm and my ears felt plugged.
I started on my evening chores and I was hurting more than nor-
mal. Passing the corner of the cabin I reached for my good hiking staff 
and tucked it under my arm. It touched the sore spots on ribs and arms 
perfectly.
More water on for a one-hour session of hot packs. During the 
process I wondered if heat is best for muscle spasms. Cold is better for a 
sprain until the swelling starts to recede.
No messing around tonight. I cleared the lower bunk and moved my 
slumber bag down near mother earth. To get into that upper bunk is a 
pain of the first order.
April 18, 1979:
Overcast, Breeze dn. & 32 degrees.
I turned in before eight and spent a pretty good night in my low 
level bunk, but getting up from the horizontal position is a very painful 
operation. At five, I got up and took two aspirin and turned in again 
wondering just how long it takes two aspirin to grab a hold. In forty-five 
minutes I could feel the difference and in twice that time I was feeling 
much better.
I tried another hour of hot towels and it seemed I was hurting more 
when I finished than when I started.
So – at nine I laid down on top of my sleeping bag and covered 
myself with a G.I. wool blanket. I had taken an Excedrin to help me 
 115

rest a bit better. I slept some and didn’t roll out till near noon.
I had a bite to eat and then proceeded to neatin up the cabin a bit. 
I didn’t feel up to getting down and leveling the floor with the straight 
edge but did wet it and used my broom. The water plug was loose today 
but down deep I could see that the hole made by the ice chisel is closing 
so it has been making a little ice. Ice cold water, I have a lake full of it. 
To me it seemed about as sensible as falling on my sword to try it but 
one time I would try cold packs. Cold! well I guess, but I soon got used 
to it and made it a one hour session. It seemed I felt less pain at the end 
than with hot, but after awhile it came and I felt cool. Muscle spasms 
came easier and more intense. I toughed it out.
April 19, 1979: 
Overcast, Calm, & 25 degrees.
It’s a long night from eight to five when it requires just an awful 
lot of effort to move just a little bit. Even a slight adjustment in posi-
tion stirs up those hornets and it takes minutes for them to settle down 
again.
I did feel better this morning and was sure that now the tide had 
turned. No big muscle spasm when I slowly eased myself to a sitting 
position and then to my feet. Now we could get with the rehabilitation 
program.
A nice morning at 25 degrees and I left the top door open. I man-
aged my morning chores in better than usual fashion and then took 
an hour of therapy with the hot towel but not so hot as before. My ace 
bandage in place I felt like a little exercise was in order so followed the 
shoreline down around Erv’s high lookout. Probably I was nearly three 
quarters of a mile from my beach when I turned back.
That was a pretty good hike and I laid down to rest for an hour and 
a half. The day was looking fair but still unsettled over the lower lake.
After lunch another hour of hot towels and then I did a little 
improving on my path to the lake with the long handled no. 2. Remove 
some excess snow that was crowding the path at one point. Dressed 
up the path a bit with the broom and called that enough of strenuous 
exercise. An early supper this evening and I would have a green salad 
from a head of lettuce Glen brought last trip. Lettuce, carrot, onion, and 
raw potato with my famous sourdough salad dressing made with white 
sugar, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, chili powder, seasoned salt, vin-
egar, and water. The Kodiak storekeeper Bob Acheson made a big fuss 
about that salad dressing. At the time I thought he liked it but I have 
been known to think all wrong. It is the best at Twin Lakes that’s true.
Bob Acheson purchased Spike and Hope’s two cabins but because the land 
was not deeded property, these cabins became trespass cabins within Lake 
Clark National Monument. The Acheson’s children continued to use these cab-
ins, visiting Dick while he lived at Twin Lakes. We have welcomed their

Chapter 2
return on several occasions, and enjoy and learn from their memories. Many 
visitors to Dick’s cabin since 2000 were lucky to have Rob Acheson or his 
sister, Jill, give a tour when one of the Achesons volunteered to meet visitors, 
giving K. and me time off.
April 20, 1979: 
Overcast, Calm, & 32 degrees.
One of the many things I like about this Twin Lakes hospital is that 
it is quiet at night. No room partner moaning and groaning. No nurses 
coming in to check pulse and temperature. No chatter from the nurse’s 
station just outside, and the price is right. At the Providence they would 
have me written up for six hundred by now I suspect and I would be no 
further along.
Feeling very sore at two so I took a couple aspirin and slept well 
towards five. Doing better, not nearly so much spasm trouble when I 
rolled slowly out onto my caribou mat.
I wrote another letter and then after noon I would do a little sand-
ing. I was surprised that it went so well. Maybe fifteen minutes work 
to finish the burl bowl which I then wrapped for mailing to the lady 
in Juneau who sent me the ceramic mug. ... I had taken an hour of hot 
packs and now the bicep muscle of my right arm and my shoulder mus-
cles began to ache something fierce. My arm and shoulder had been a bit 
sore but nothing more than that. So – back to the hot springs and I was 
surprised that they soon snapped out of it.
My meat saw gave me a little trouble so I used the 4-pound pole axe 
to chunk up the last of the caribou neck bone. That’s the last of it and 
real good meat free for sledding it in.
A few items down from the cache. Some fire starter and my wood 
box filled and I was feeling as if I had done a real hard days work. Sore 
like you wouldn’t believe but very few muscle spasms.
To make my bunk softer I shifted my 4" foam mattress down on 
top of the two thin ones. It’s along time till morning when you can’t roll 
around a bit.
May 7, 1979: 
Overcast, Calm, & 32 degrees.
Eighteen-inches of heavily candled ice. [If strong winds don’t break 
apart lake ice as spring temperatures rise, melting ice will form columnar 
structures resembling vertical candles. Without wind the process can reach a state 
where each candle within the ice layer is floating as a vertical icicle, often more 
than a foot long, with no structural integrity. At this stage even a light breeze 
will starting breaking up the ice.] I had better push my big sled if I crossed. 
While I was dragging it out of retirement I noticed my seven foot, 
five inch wide skis standing in the corner and a life jacket hung from a 
purlin log. Take them all just in case. Glasses and scope would go. No 
camera for I wouldn’t be climbing the mountain today. The sled made 
 117

just enough noise to drown out the squeak of the ice. I could use the sled 
handlebars to support some of my weight. A few times I have dragged 
the canoe but it makes so much noise that one time I spooked a sow and 
cubs over the top by using it. Doing fine, a few soft spots but not too 
bad. About 200 yards from the far shore ... the ice was no longer half 
white but blue and I found it to be of fine texture. Well onto it and it got 
soft and softer. The ice under me turned even more blue. It was sagging 
and water was coming up through. I climbed onto the sled and slid my 
skis out behind. That did it but even with the skis I was leaving a blue 
trail. White ice and solid near the beach. A border of water but the sled 
takes care of that. Push it in and use it for a bridge.
May 11, 1979: 
Clear, Calm, & 25 degrees.
I had my hotcakes and then went to check the ice again. It seemed 
safe enough to walk on but I don’t enjoy traveling on rotten ice that 
measures anywhere from fifteen inches on down and especially when 
packing a load. I could push the sled and haul my skis but still I

hesitated. A guy has to draw the line on the safe side. I have often won-
dered what would be the results if a severe earthquake occurred when 
the ice was squeaky rotten and I was half way across.
I decided to stay on this side today. 
July 21, 1979: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm, & 40 degrees.
The morning looked perfect for plane day and I wondered if Babe 
and Mary [Alsworth] would make the run. I was up early to have my 
place in good order and the beach without a track on it.
…Babe fished out the mail and groceries and we each packed a load, 
cleaning the beach. A big sack of lettuce, carrots, cabbage, peaches, 
apples, muskmelon, cherry tomatoes, pickles and cheese. ‘A gift from 
us’, Mary said.
He [Jake] sent my camera back and my crampons and a batch of 
candy bars and peanuts. Things wouldn’t run so smooth in “One Man’s 
Wilderness” if it wasn’t for that boy in Smogville. Twenty-three letters 
counting four or five of a business nature.
August 2, 1979: 
Clear, Calm, & 36 degrees.
I woke up at four and saw the sun light the mountains down country 
soon after. Another pretty day and I was up to stay at 4:15. Today would 
be a good day to go up Hope Creek and climb to my peak at the head of 
the 2nd canyon. A few clouds would only make the pictures nice but I 
didn’t want the Kijik River’s upper reaches in shadow.
It was going to be a warm day if it stayed clear so I would dress cool. 
Give those beefed up crampons the test for it is a good climb and some rock.
Clouds forming and coming over the high ridge at a good clip. A 
mile to go and a snow patch leading nearly to the ridge. I changed to 
hiking boots and crampons. The snow wet near the bottom but became 
more solid as I climbed and I suspect it froze a little high up. At last the 
ridge looking towards Redoubt and Illiamna Volcanoes. Cotton clouds, 
lots of them hanging about the many peaks.
The sun moved around and Redoubt was framed by clouds. A 
beautiful scene and worth the climb to see it. No watch along and it is 
seldom that I carry one any more. Illiamna Volcano came in the clear 
and still putting out that huge volume of steam.
Heading for home and just below the peak a very long and steep 
snow patch leads down. A better way if you don’t lose your grip and slide 
and maybe roll and tumble until you hit a rock out crop below. Other 
wise it was travel the ups and downs of the ridge back to where I had 
climbed. Some hazards in the form of loose rock there too. I lashed on 
my spikes and eased over the edge. Kick a good foothold before letting 
go of the last one. It was slow but going down instead of scrambling over 
 119

the minor peaks. The snow was wet and soft now. It would ball up under 
the crampons and make the spikes ineffective. Stop and rap them a good 
one with my walking staff to dislodge it. No spills and I was soon travel-
ing at a rate that would take me to Hope Creek in 45 minutes.
“My peak” is four-and-a-half miles up Hope Canyon, and 3,500' above 
Twin Lakes on a rocky, rubble hump along the extended ridge separating the 
watershed of Twin Lakes from the rugged Kijik River drainage. It is not a 
towering mountain and this fits what I know of Dick, that it is this ridge-line 
peak he referred to as “my peak” or “my mountain.” We now call it Proenneke 
Peak. From the valley floor the peak is slightly more than a half-mile in dis-
tance and up 2,000' of loose scree and rotten rock. Dick’s description of choos-
ing between the “very long and steep snow patch” and “loose rock” creates an 
understated image of descending either route from this ridge.
Dick loved to hike to “my peak.” The view is stunning. In 2001, not 
knowing its significance in Dick’s life, I laid on this ridge watching a gryfal-
con escort a golden eagle out of the area more than a thousand feet above me. 
Once the eagle was on its way out of the gryfalcon’s defended territory, the 
gryfalcon dove on me before circling ever closer, just a hundred feet overhead. 
Minutes later I spotted the gryfalcon’s fledging sitting on the cliff below. 
In 2003, Dick’s ashes were buried near a flowering spotted saxifrage on 
“Proenneke Peak.” K. and I, along with four park service employees includ-
ing historian John Branson, ranger/pilot Leon Alsworth, head ranger Lee 
Fink and ranger Warren Hill, took part in Dick’s Last Hike. Dick’s brother 
Raymond was part of choosing this spot for Dick’s ashes. As we approached 
the peak a few Dall sheep walked from the peak. They stood below, feeding as 
we held a tribute to Dick.

On the way down we picked blueberries. I made sourdough blueberry 
pancakes using Dick’s starter. Sitting outside Spike’s cabin we looked through 
a spotting scope and watched the Dall sheep standing on the peak. 
In 2016, K. and I, along with our friends and volunteers at the Lower 
Twin ranger cabin, Dan Molina and Jennifer Jones Molina, took Raymond 
Proenneke’s ashes to leave next to Dick’s unmarked site. Again, Dall sheep 
were on the peak as we approached. Having looked through the scope at 
Proenneke Peak dozens of times through the years, I wonder the meaning of 
seeing sheep there only on those two occasions.

After supper I went out to check the ice to see how much had 
melted since yesterday morning. I took my big skis along and used them 
for I found it soft and squeaky. 22 inches it measured, down 2 inches 
since yesterday morning.
May 18, 1980: 
Overcast, Snowing, Breeze dn. & 30 degrees. 
How had the lake ice stood the last couple days. I took my skis and 
measuring stick and headed out. I would carry the skis till I needed 
them. A good start but then squeaking and it got worse and worse. I 
finally chickened out and got onto the slats. Now what do you do when 
the slats won’t carry you? – That’s a good question.

Today would be snowshoe repair day. Two years ago I got 1 lb. of 
3/8" neoprene filling for $17.00 (L.L. Bean) to do the center sections. 
Patched them up for the winter of 78-79 and was out last winter. Now, 
patch them again or make those center sections totally new. All the 
necessary cabin chores done I cut into the loose one and found it did 
need considerable work done to make it trouble free. Yesterday when I

was in the cache I didn’t think of the neoprene but today I knew I hadn’t 
seen it. If it was back in that far corner I was tempted to soak some 
moose hide lacing I had cut and do another repair job. I cut until I had 
a stack of cuttings on the table and could see where it might be wise to 
cut more. The hoops or frames needed some scraping and sanding where 
they had been wrapped with rawhide. That done they needed a coat of 
Varathane and then it would have to dry. I put some moose hide lacing 
to soak. I didn’t want to empty the cache again.
Coming back I was thinking about that neoprene lacing. I could 
empty that cache in fifteen minutes if I got with the program but 
maybe I wouldn’t have to. It might be high on the stack of boxes in 
the left rear corner. On the beach and gear put away I climbed up and 
crawled in. Pulled that good Eddie Bauer -20° sleeping bag out of its 
niche and fished back in the corner. Out came the L.L. bean box on 
which was written snowshoe lacing. So – I am committed to learn 
something about the art of filling snowshoes. In the Yukon and near 
Watson Lake I remember seeing the nicest snowshoes. Filling almost 
as fine as lace to carry those natives over that deep, very cold, very dry, 
very loose snow.
November 5, 1980: 
Overcast, Calm, & 20°.
To start my working day I cut the rest of the filling from one snow-
shoe. I would save the other untouched for a pattern. The frame scraped 
and sanded. A coat of varathane thinned with a little Jet fuel “B” to 
hasten the drying time. 
It was one P.M. when I came in. A bite to eat and I cleared the 
deck for snowshoe rebuild. I would do it on the gravel out front. Better 
light and lots of room for that very long length of nylon coated with 
neoprene. Didn’t enter my feeble brain that I should mark the center. I 
wouldn’t dare cut it in the center for fear of being short a foot – so – all 
that length would have to go through every loop and hole. Binding stuff 
– it can’t be threaded through three or four tucks and pulled tight. It 
must be one at a time and fifty feet or more to go through. It was slow 
but not difficult with the untouched mate laying next to the one I was 
threading. For a beginner it takes concentration to keep from making a 
boo boo and having to unravel the whole mess to do it right.
One would have to look close to see the mistake but I would see it 
every time I admired my good looking filling job. Right at 24 feet of 
material left and I wish I knew how much I used. Till now I haven’t cut 
it so may unravel the whole mess and do it right. If the length is criti-
cal I might be able to gain a very few inches. Interesting, and can see it 
being done without thinking if a man did it full time. How many gener-
ations of Indian from the first crude snowshoes to the very beautiful and 
complicated filling patterns of today.

I’m thinking I have seen the last of the sun from my cabin until 
February.
A session of letter writing last evening and then before turning in I 
unraveled yesterdays knitting. A good three hours to do the job and 30 
minutes to undo it. After my spuds and chores this morning I stretched 
the lacing out on the beach. 59 feet of it. It had taken 35 feet to fill that 
one center section. The total length short about 11 feet to do both shoes. 
I had some improvements in mind as to how I could do a neater job. It 
had to do with the spacing of the warp cords (cross wise) and another 
minor detail or two. So – I got with the program but inside this time. 
My pattern shoe on the table and the victim across my knee. Not so 
much gravel flying from all that lacing whipping back and forth. Trying 
to do a tighter job this time and no boo-boo’s. I had studied the project 
thoroughly and had a rule of thumb figured out. Filling angling across 
to one side under the warp and that angling the other direction over the 
warp. Weaving would take place where they crossed when they crossed. 
Nothing to it like the man said about flying just before he ran off the 
runway on roll out, hit a 55-gallon drum but didn’t leap frog over it. It 
pitched him and his Tri-Pacer on their backs. But I was being overcon-
fident with my system and missed a stitch and my spacing gave trouble 
too. So – I would take it apart again and I would put it back before 
knocking off for lunch. Doing much better and a real neat looking job. 
The last go round near 2:30 and there it was again – two tucks missing. 
Its tricky – doesn’t show until you are well by the mistake. Now I see why 
snowshoes cost $67.00. If I were to make any money at filling them they 
would cost three times that and maybe more (haven’t completed the job 
yet). Only a little way to go so I finished it and found I had gained 31⁄ 2 
inches over yesterday. A real tight filling job and sore hands to prove it.
There had to be a way to cut down on length so I dug out my L.L. 
Bean catalogue. Their trail model snowshoe is much like mine but uses 
less rows of lacing both length wise and cross wise. A little measuring 
and I see where I can do both shoes with the 59 feet of lacing I have. 
Enough of pulling strings for one day, I wanted some thing more relax-
ing to end the day. Some thing like making wood so I took my equip. to 
the jungle and bucked up the tree I started yesterday.

Today I would enjoy slaving in the snowshoe factory. It was near 
nine when I started to unravel yesterday’s work and working fast it took 
a good half hour to pull the filling out. I didn’t dare cut it for I wasn’t 
sure that I could refill it with the different pattern and use only half of 
the 59-feet.

Now, ready to start and this time I would use the catalogue picture 
for reference. A small picture and I couldn’t tell all the over and unders 
by looking so I would use my own judgment, good and bad. I liked the 
pattern better for it gave more room for attaching the bindings and too 
the weave would be more coarse and the snowshoe wouldn’t have that 
overfilled look due to the neoprene lacing being wider than the rawhide.
The lacing job went well but I wasn’t at all sure that it would turn 
out perfect after two days and a flaw or two showing up near the end 
on each try. This job of filling would be one of a kind and my system 
so who could say it was right or wrong. Last night I got up once to rub 
some healing salve on my sore finger tips and today I would wipe blood 
a time or two after pulling the skin loose at the base of a fingernail.
It was past twelve when I received the sad news – had to go over two 
instead of over and under. As much as I studied it I couldn’t see how it 
could be any other way – so – I went to the bitter end to see how much 
lacing I had for the second shoe. If I had not enough by two inches I 
would be pretty unhappy.
By the tape 29 feet-5 inches. One-inch less than half. The stretch in 
30-feet I estimate to be nearly 4 inches so I should have enough. With 
the little tin snips I cut her 1⁄2-inch from the knot.
Ready for no. 2 shoe so I used my wood mallet on a heavy hunting 
knife to cut the lacing in line with the frame. Save those old fillings 
and wonder how many miles of service they had given. I have read 
that on dry cold snow, wind packed I suspect, that rawhide will out 
last neoprene. In spring when the snow gets wet neoprene is by far the 
best. And being rubber snow and ice won’t stick to it – we shall see. The 
second frame scraped sanded and Varathaned.

Overcast, Blowing dn. & 26°.
This morning I would complete my snowshoes. Put the chafing gear, 
bindings and crampons on. It was noon when I finished. Real proud of 
those snowshoes and I would bet my poke of gold that they will give no 
trouble for years to come – as far as the center sections are concerned.
November 13, 1980: 
Partly Cloudy, Blowing dn. & 27°.
Today the lake was rough enough out in the deep center or I would 
have climbed the mountain across. Instead, I would do small jobs about 
camp, have an early sandwich and then try Hope Creek. It’s a tough trail 
in winter. Steep side slope with many deep cuts filled with snow and 
drifted from down the creek winds that causes very steep snow banks 
to climb. Usually it’s a very hungry country in winter – much snow and 
very little wind swept sheep country. This one time I would go and then 
wait until early spring when the creek bottom is the perfect snowshoe 
trail into beautiful snow country.

The going was as I had suspected but crampons made the difference 
between going and turning back. I would see a few ptarmigan tracks 
and a mile up the track of Milo the weasel. No fox had ventured up or 
down and Mr. Wolverine hasn’t checked it out.
December 4, 1980: 
Partly Cloudy, V. Lt. Breeze dn. & 5°.
A chance to try my brand new G.I. ice creepers from Army, Navy, 
Surplus at $3.95. Half way to the point and good-looking ice I buckled 
then on. I liked them much better than crampons that are too severe on 
lake ice.
December 7, 1980: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm, & 6°.
This upper lake had been scoured clean. It was like one huge skat-
ing rink with a few blemishes caused by cracks and water coming to the 
surface of the ice. It would be a good chance for my G.I. ice creepers to 
prove themselves.
On the glare ice I learned real soon that it wasn’t my good positive 
traction crampons I was wearing. The G.I. creepers only cover the soles 
of my Canadian Sorel shoe pacs. No traction for the heels so those soles 
must touch the ice almost the instant the heels do or you have a stabil-
ity problem. And it is worse if you cross a snow patch and get the heels 
coated with snow. That first step or two on bare ice can be the beginning 
of fast action. To the stream and the lower lake. A big surprise there.  
It was still snow white and frost covered. Either the 
wind didn’t blow or the frost was well tied to the ice. 
No creepers needed and I took them off.

Creepers for the upper lake and this time I did it. Snow on my 
heels and my feet went forward. A pretty good fall but no damage done 
except to the reputation of the Army gear.
December 8, 1980: 
Clear, Calm, & -5°.
First project was to work on my ice creepers. Adjust them to fit 
better and tape the fool straps so I can just slip them on fasten one 
strap and go instead of fiddling with three straps and the keepers with 
bare fingers at -5°. A short length of chain with web strap on each end 
goes under the instep and nothing to keep the chain centered and not 
be walking on the strap – so – I centered the chains and wired them 
securely. I gave them a little test and feel sure that they will do much 
better but they can still drop the back of my head on the ice.
The sun looked so nice and warm on the mountain, I decided 
to climb to the big pasture and enjoy spring like weather. Wear my 
Appalachian hikers and crampons. Gaiters too so as not to snag the legs 
of my dress whites. A “Joni” hand warmer in a woolen mitten in case of 
cold fingers. When it comes to hard slick ice you just can’t beat cram-
pons. Take 3-foot steps if you like and with complete confidence.
December 10, 1980: 
Clear, Calm, & -16°.
First project – make that second ice creeper as good as the first one 
and it didn’t take half as long. I wanted to go over to the moose rutting 
cottonwoods but first I would sled a load of wood down from the point.
December 22, 1980: 
Clear, Calm, & -18°.
I wrote letters for I half expected Glen tomorrow. Wrote and wrote 
until the sun said I had better get hiking. This afternoon creepers made 
much more ice chips than usual as if the ice was very hard and brittle. It 
has entered a new faze of its symphony. Now there is seldom a crash and 
a roar but a roar building until it seems to cover nearly half of the lake 
and then slowly fades.
December 24, 1980: 
Clear, Calm, & -14°.
It came time to climb and no Glen. I suspected he had a lot of flying 
to do this day before Christmas and he had put my trip on hold until 
tomorrow. Curses – one spike gone from the right hand ice creeper. It 
has a rivet head and goes through three thicknesses of thin metal. The 
hinge joint of the adjustment and a weak point for sure. No time to put 
in a stove bolt – I ran a piece of haywire through and twisted it. I still 
had time judging from the light pattern on the mountain.

A little improvement for my ice creepers. A sleeve of gas can tin 
around the adjustment strips to hold the tail ends, trailing, straight 
back. When free to swing the heel claws would sometimes swing right 
or left.

Overcast, Calm (Lt. Breeze dn.) & 30°.
After my sourdoughs I broke out my super snow shovel and cleared 
my pathways, fetched my water and proceeded to get a few last letters 
ready for licking shut. Using the shovel I saw where a small improve-
ment could be made to make it more agreeable to operate so dug into 
my tool can for hacksaw and hurdy gurdy drill. A couple small bolts 
replaced sheet metal screws that worked loose. The hacksaw to bob a 
couple clamps that raked the gravel.
January 22, 1981: 
Overcast, Breeze up & 0°. 
Snowing and building most all night and come daylight right at six 
inches of light as feathers snow covered everything.
I had my spuds before putting my big snow shovel to work. Till now 
I have cleared the path to the water hole but a wind will end that chore. 
Do as Babe did – walk it down all winter and let the sun shovel it come 
spring.
February 13, 1981: 
Clear, Calm, & -19°.
Today I wanted to check the thickness of the ice too – so after a bite 
to eat I went out far enough for a true reading and with axe shovel and 
ice chisel I struck water at about 32 inches.
I have been thinking that I could sure make good use of an ice 
auger. Wouldn’t have so much crushed ice to contend with at the water 
hole and checking the ice for thickness would be quick and easy.
If I had an extension for my old 2-inch wood auger, that I used in 
building the cabin, it might work. A piece of 1⁄ 2" gas pipe would do but 
none in captivity. Behind the woodshed I had a batch of aluminum tent 
poles about the right size. Square the hole in one end to take the square 
shank of the auger shaft. Shape the opposite end around the head of a 
3/8" aircraft bolt and put a half-inch hose clamp around it. Square the 
thread end of the bolt to take the carpenters brace. So – I worked at 
it. Now it stands on the stove to set the epoxy that fills the cracks and 
crevasses. Get that auger plenty warm and I’m thinking it will make a 
hole in the ice without sticking. My water hole needed some attention.

the walls of the pocket formed by the plug. Each time it is removed it 
fails to go quite as deep when I put it back. In time it is half above the 
ice. So – I chopped a big triangle deep enough and put it back down to 
ice level.

Clear, Calm, & -2°.
I wouldn’t trade Twin Lakes scenery for a dozen from Miller Creek 
or Lake Clark. Back by three and I thought of my ice auger I had made. 
All it needed now was a bit shank end filed on the bolt that is gripped 
by the jaws of the carpenters brace. I was soon ready to give it a try. I 
opened the door of the stove and warmed the auger good. Took the 
teakettle along in case I got stuck. At first try I was a little disappointed. 
It was cutting slow. To auger through 32 inches of ice would take nearly 
that many minutes. Then as it cooled it began to do better. Cutting dry 
ice and I could hear and feel it cutting. No problem of it choking up and 
sticking as it would do in wood. 32 inches when it broke through. By 
relieving the cutting edges on the backside I could make it cut faster. 
Just the ticket for my water hole. Melt the plug out and then run the 
auger down to water. Won’t have to bail out a bucket of chips before I 
get ice-free water.

This morning I had a chance to put my ice auger to work. Thaw the 
plug out and then auger on down. Why it would be worth the price of 
spending a cold dark winter just for the convenience of the water system. 
Better than city water even if it was good. The auger with extension is 
48 inches long. The stem marked at one-inch intervals. Interesting to 
crank her down and watch the marks as she goes. When she breaks 
through that’s it.
March 12, 1981: 
Partly Cloudy, Blowing dn. & 28°.
I wanted to do some work on one of my snowshoe crampons so 
made a work bench of my writing table and added some metal to beef it 
up. I had improved on the other one when I made it after making this 
one so now they are alike.
March 31, 1981:  
Partly Cloudy, Calm, & 6°.
Even the drifted snow was very light and my king size shovel make 
short work of opening my road system.

Partly Cloudy, Calm, & 2°.
I cut through the timber past the Vanderpool cabin headed for the 
lower lake. Suddenly I had a snowshoe failure. The right hand strap that 
forms a loop over the toe and under the toe cord on each side had worn 
thin and parted. It pays to have your Old Timer in your left rear corner 
pocket. What can a man do if he doesn’t have a knife. Simple matter to 
cut a slit near the end of both pieces and make a saddle string hook up. 
Shortened the strap by three inches but it was six inches too long.
May 11, 1981: 
Overcast, Breeze dn. & 40°.
A few other small chores to do and then I would go check on my 
sheep. Ten or a dozen down country along the slope and maybe one 
high and alone. Only a mile farther, I would go and pay my respects 
to Mrs. hawk. The ice though rough was very slippery due to the high 
temperature and I wore my G.I. ice creepers on my old hip boots.

To end the day I scraped my pathways smooth with the king size 
snow shovel. Cleared the snow from and around the canoe on the beach.

Acheson would be proud of me if he knew. They, on the ranch, fly the

gave me a new flag for Twin Lakes.

Clear, calm and a -38°.
My ice chisel needed some attention before ice cutting time. 
The chisel loose in the end of the spruce pole handle. In making the 
ice chisel I had ripped the pole down the center for about 21⁄ 2-feet. 
Wedged the two halves apart at the end and carved a bed to fit the 
chisel shank and 7/8" diameter head. Laid the chisel shank in and closed 
the two halves. A couple clenched nails held it together. A few winters 
of chipping ice had loosened it and I wanted it solid again. Opened the 
cut again and mixed some Elmer’s wood glue and birch sanding dust. 
Applied a generous amount to each half of the cavity and put the chisel 
in place. Tied a couple nylon cords around and inserted twisting sticks 
(80 penny spikes). Wound them up tight and the putty came creeping 
out. Let it dry a day or two and then put some new wire clamps around 
the end and I’m ready for ice.
November 18, 1981: 
Clear, Calm, & 2°.
Did the fine sanding on my latest carving and gave the one of birch 
the flame treatment. Sanded the tip of the blade on the L.L. Bean 
paddle and gave it a coat of epoxy. Varathane for the carvings and scuff 
marks on the paddle. The chisel end of the ice chisel pole got a coat too 
in hopes it would survive the winter in better shape. Last evening I had 
dipped the last bucket of water from the lake. From now to near break 
up it will be, open that water hole every day.
How much ice would I find ten feet from shore? 11⁄ 2-inches that is 
pretty good for above zero weather over less than a 24-hour period. As 
the sun left the peaks I strapped on my ice creepers and walked the ice 
around the point. A little spooky some places. The ice so clear it seemed 
I was walking on water and 10 feet of it below… The ice starting to 
complain a bit. [Twin Lakes froze the night of November 17th.]
November 19, 1981: 
Clear, Calm, & -8°.
At two I woke up to hear the ice on a rampage. Like some one 
gone wild with a giant glass cutter. Now and again before the king size 
ripping sound it was as if some one dropped a huge bowling ball. It went 
on and on before stopping within a few minutes.
We had made some much needed ice during the night. After break-
fast I took the 4 lb. single bit and my measuring stick a hundred-yards 
out. Real close to 21⁄ 2" and I found it the same near the breakwater 
where I get my water. Safe enough and I dressed for a little tour on the 
 131
A Land of Snow & Ice
lake. Down a half and then I circled right towards Falls Creek. Not a 
sound from the ice but walk near a fresh crack I could see the ice on my 
side sag a bit and water oozed up through. Spooky! and I didn’t follow 
those cracks. Come to a junction of two and that point could very well 
break and cause a damp foot or worse.
Again this afternoon the ice threw a fit for an hour or more and 
became quiet except for an occasional out burst … When I got my water 
supply I found the ice three inches. So – dishes done I headed towards 
Low Pass point. I found the ice more slippery with the mild tempera-
ture and came back to strap on my creepers. Many big welts on the ice. 
Water coming up through fresh crack spreads, freezes and builds to a 
depth of an inch or more before it stops. I was a half-mile out or a bit 
more and thought, being a little dark as it was made those cracks less 
spooky. What you can’t see doesn’t make you hold your breath. Suddenly 
it happened. Stepped on one of those welts and went through as if there 
was nothing but slush below. Didn’t fall but got wet halfway to my left 
knee. What had caused that soft spot? I didn’t stop to investigate – just 
circled 50-yards over and crossed the crack where there was no slush to 
hide a trap. A damp foot but only damp. My pant leg would be frozen 
solid by the time I got to the stove. Enough ice touring for today. I 
angled over to the shoreline and followed it back. It was a strange case – 
no breaking of ice – just nothing there but slush.
November 20, 1981: 
Clear, Calm, & 2°.
A real nice morning and I was quite sure that all the leaks in the 
lake had been sealed during the night. Today I would find out what 
caused that wet spot last evening… while waiting for the day to brighten 
I shuffled across the far side and back. Along the way and near the far 
side I saw some good evidence as strange as it might seem. The ice had 
cracked and spread a good eight inches. Spring is the time for the ice to 
crack and separate by two-feet, not freeze up time. Then a second place. 
A long rough lined crack with ice pushed up at crazy angles. And there 
was a small area that had been badly broken. Walk onto that in the dark 
and you would hurry home if you got out of it. Crazy, I had never seen 
new ice act like this. I would go down and see what had trapped me. 
The sun was just lighting the peaks as I went crunching down in the 
general direction I had gone. Why I could see the line from 200-yards. 
Ice pushed up by the two sides of the crooked line sliding in opposite 
directions. I followed the line to the left and came to the spot. There was 
my creeper marks and there was the spot of clear new ice where my foot 
had gone through. The ice, shifting, had left an opening more than a 
foot wide and six feet either way would have missed it. On the far side I 
could follow my path by the rough ice caused from my pant leg dribbling 
and quickly freezing. Let that be a lesson – don’t walk the young ice 
when you can’t see the sucker traps.

My pathway onto the lake ice had firmed up. Water saturated snow 
is slow in freezing unless it is disturbed. I had made tracks in the slush 
and dragged my big shovel over them so it would freeze smooth.
No climbing gear on my snowshoes but I had two long walk-
ing sticks to use as ski poles in climbing. Lots of snow, in fact, I can’t 
remember climbing in more snow at timberline … It wasn’t an easy 
climb without climbing gear but I made it in one slow pull. Snow curling 
over the edge of the big pasture and from Allen’s peak. It came sharp 
and cold at my winter sun look out while I stood watching the sheep 
working along the steep edge of the rock face. Then something happened 
to make the climb worth the effort. Onto the sky line from behind the 
face walked that best of all the good rams. Head on and broadside I saw 
him with the glasses. Better than full curl and horns heavy and dark. He 
is a world-beater and I must make a try for footage of him.
A bite to eat and then I did add climbing gear to the hoops of my 
snowshoes. With three eighth line I outlined the center sections with a 
series of marlin hitches on the bottoms of the side rails and cross bars. 
Later I would add my homemade crampons.
December 28, 1981:

My homemade crampons for the snowshoes did a perfect job on 
the climb and would coming down also. I made the trip [to Low Pass] 
nonstop and arrived at the summit about 1 PM.

My ice auger was patiently waiting to be completed. A good sturdy 
looking piece of winter equipment when I clamped the brace chunk onto 
that new drill shank. A nylon tether between drill stem and brace so no 
chance of the chuck letting go and dropping the auger to the bottom of 
the lake. I have thought of that possibility many times in the past.
Time to try my ice auger. It had been very mild since yesterdays 
drilling but the 17/8" hole had closed. It takes ice awhile to warm after 
a cold spell and to get cold after a warm spell. Happy to report that it 
worked perfect. No wobble at the chuck to drill shank connection.

My ice auger is a slow cutter due to the pilot feed screw on the end. 
I could remove it but then the auger would be no good for wood if I ever 
needed to auger wood.

I looked for my chill chart and found it. I wasn’t far wrong when I 
said -70 or -75 yesterday afternoon. -20° and 20 mph wind has the same 
effect as -68° with the air calm. 25 mph wind gives a reading of -75°. I’ll 
buy that as cold enough.
My urethaning to do and some repairs to make. The crampons to 
disassemble and package for mailing to Jake the welder. Too bad the 
company can’t build equipment as tough as Twin Lakes country requires 
to be trouble free.

Writing went well and it was twelve before I quit. I wanted to do a 
little work on my snowshoes before heading down the lake. My snow-
shoe crampons were chafing that good neoprene filling and that must 
not be, so – I took them off.
May 3, 1982: 
Clear, Calm & 7°.
I have declared the snowshoe season complete for the winter of 
81-82 so after breakfast and chores done I brought them in to warm 
behind the stove. After sanding the first coat on the knife handle I 
removed my climbing gear from the snowshoes and sanded the scuffed 
areas. Then a coat of urethane for both the knife handle and snowshoes. 
They covered many a mile during the winter and I fail to see that there 
is sign of wear on the new neoprene filling in the center sections.
November 17, 1982: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & -4°.
Back at the cabin I had bread rising and I wanted to work on my 
ice auger. The ice about an inch thick out front. After I boiled my water 
supply I installed my plastic water hole plug. Worked on the shank of 
the auger so the brace chuck would hold it with out risk of losing it in 
the deep.
November 22, 1982: 
Partly Cloudy, Blowing dn. & 31°.
Snow on my roof was a sorry sight. With the 30° temperatures the 
snow melted over the living area but remained about a foot deep over 
the eaves and over hang in front and rear. Much ice along the edge too 
which I wanted to dispose of. So – I set my ladder up and got onto the 
frozen edge. Counter clockwise around I went pitching the snow well 
clear with my old no. 2. Chopped the ice along the edge and shoveled it 
clear of my walkways. Looked better at least.

Really how strong was the wind out in the long run of the lake. I 
pulled on my windbreakers and buckled on my ice creepers. The ice very 
smooth and looked wet because of the warm wind. Without ice creepers 
I couldn’t have crossed and had I been on my pumpkin seed G.I. sled I 
could have had a fast ride to the lower end without the aid of a sail.
December 1, 1982: 
Clear, Calm & -40°. 
My ice auger failed to penetrate the very cold ice. The pilot screw 
plugged with ice. Twice I brought it to the cabin to melt it free with hot 
water. Put it out in the cold clean and dry. Again it was a little cone of 
ice after the first turn. I came for the ice chisel and found the ice very 
hard and brittle. Seven-inches was the thickness.
December 2, 1982: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & -34°.
This morning I would work on my ice auger. It has always been a 
slow cutter and that was understandable. The pilot screw would allow it 
to cut at the speed the screw penetrated the ice. I thought of cutting the 
screw off but then it would be no good as a wood auger if I ever needed 
it for that. So I altered the shape of the screw and tried it – no good. I 
filed more and still no good. Another couple times I changed the shape 
and angle of things but got no results. So – I filed the screw thin and 
broke it off. Filed the cutting edges so they met in the center. That did 
it. It is an ice auger now and a joy to use.
My snowshoe bindings needed an improvement. Coming down 
steep pitches my pacs work too far forward and toes rub the cross bar 
ahead of toe cord. Tighten the binding across the toe makes them too 
tight and cold feet is the result.
So by the fire I studied the situation. I had a couple short neoprene 
nylon straps saved from too long crampon straps. So, I fastened one end 
to the toe cord (under the ball of my foot) – took it forward and up over 
the toe to come back and fasten to the binding straps across the top of 
the toe. That should do it and tomorrow will say for sure.

I buckled on my creepers, took my ice auger and measuring stick 
and went out beyond my runway to check the ice. It is surprising that a 
little ice is made at 30° or a bit lower. I notice it at my water hole. The ice 
thick enough now that it will freeze under my plastic water hole plug. 
My ice auger is the cuttingest machine I know of. If I really got with the 
program I could go through a lot of ice in one minute.

Never use an axe while on snowshoes. It seems that snowshoes are a 
magnet for the sharp cutting edge. I had done it before several times and 
it was always the rawhide exposed on the outside of the frames, hoops 
or whatever. Just to touch them with the axe left ends where it should 
be continuous. So – I had learned but yesterday there was small willow 
blocking my trail coming out with a load. I was on snowshoes and had 
axe in hand. Chopping brush in deep snow is a losing proposition. In 
the hacking there came a dull solid sound of axe hitting snowshoe. I was 
afraid to look for it struck along side of the center section and my neo-
prene lacing. If I sliced it where it wrapped around the frame I was in 
real trouble. In lacing I had stretched that nylon rubber lacing very tight. 
I went on out to the beach and unloaded my wood before going back for 
the second load. I would check that snowshoe now. The climbing gear of 
synthetic line laced along the edge with marlin hitches was cut – several 
straight across as if cut with a sharp knife. No sign that I had touched 
the neoprene lacing but how could I miss? There is more area covered by 
lacing than not. Just the slightest nick in the wood frame between two 
loops of lacing was the extent of the damage. How lucky can one brush 
rat be? So this morning after breakfast, chores, ice check and a little 
walk on the ice I proceeded to repair my climbing gear and also sew and 
cement some rubber lugs on the back side of my pacs to prevent the heel 
straps of the bindings from slipping above the rubber bottoms.

so when I got back I remodeled one using a different system. Gave it a 
little test run on the ice and liked it.

December 22, 1982: 
Clear, Cold, & 0°. 
A fine morning and I was up at 6:30 to have my hotcakes and get 
my work done. I wanted to see the sun come to the high ones this 22nd 
day of December. I was ready and it was still early so I went for a walk 
down the ice. It was making a big fuss and sometimes it can be startling 
to have the ice let go with a crash under you. Years back on very thick 
ice and severe cold I was walking the ice. It was slippery and I was wear-
ing homemade creepers. Sheet metal screws with the point down were 
my spikes. As I traveled the ice cracked under me with cracks shooting 
out in many directions. Not every step but often. It was as if the ice was 
under great tension and my spikes were like so many ice picks. Never 
again have I found that same ice condition.
I headed back and just how long would it take me to walk real 
close to three miles on the ice. Laddy [Elliot] and John Branson talk of 
4 miles per hour. Never happen without really making tracks and far 
apart.
And the nice part of it no man tracks but mine in all the upper lake 
country. 50 minutes and I was on my beach. I walked fast but could have 
beat that time by a few minutes but I would have to shorten it by 10 
minutes to make 4 miles per hour. No, John, you don’t average 4 miles 
per hr. on the ice from Miller Creek to Port Alsworth (9 miles).
Dick’s journals reveal his competitiveness in both hiking and canoeing. 
Living at Twin Lakes alone, he often recorded how many minutes it took to 
hike or canoe to various places. This helped him keep in shape and also allowed 
him to put down his mark on those experiences for anyone who followed. 
Dick’s competitiveness shows up when he was alone but even more 
strongly with some men, often those much younger than himself. This was not 
the Dick I hiked with. For many of us (both male and female) who hiked and 
canoed with Dick, his competitiveness was not at all a part of the experience. 
I found Dick endlessly absorbed in a curiosity of the wilderness around him, 
empathetic and interested in the lives of those who came to visit, always will-
ing to share his experiences and wisdom. 
Dick wrote me, December 1, 1985, “Come and I will take you on a hike 
around the mt. 5hr. hike if you walk all the time but 7-8 is better.” Five hours 
is how long he would take by himself if he was not photographing or in com-
petition with a young buck. But he found great joy in being with others at a 
more relaxed pace. 
January 12, 1983: 
“Clear, Calm & -46°.” 
My most comfortable hours these days are from 9 PM to 7 AM. 
That big down bag is just right. I’m warm when I get up to check the fire 
and don’t notice the near freezing temperature inside the cabin. When 
this cool spell breaks I am going to be busy sopping water. My big

window is coated with ice and quite thick near the bottom. I will hasten 
the melting process by lighting the gas lantern and putting foil behind it 
to reflect the heat against the ice. The narrow ends of the fireplace jams 
are not insulated and I notice they are heavy with frost. Many lines of 
white between the cabin logs where the oakum chinking has frosted. 
When it stays a -40° or lower for seven days running the cold increases 
on the inside.
Sometimes I try to imagine Dick living with such vitality in his lit-
tle cabin – moisture from his breath and cooking freezing into lines of frost 
between his cabin logs where the wall thickness is only 3" in places. It’s dark 
outside for all but a few hours in the middle of the day and the sun doesn’t 
shine on his cabin for more than two months.
January 13, 1983: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & -41°.
In the very cold ice I have trouble with my ice auger if water is pres-
ent while I am augering. Melting my water hole plug loose creates some 
water that will freeze the auger fast in the hole being augered. Hot water 
will free it but not for long. So, I tried a new system. With the axe I 
chopped a little pocket to dip from and then auger to let the water come 
up. I will discontinue the plug system until milder weather.
January 17, 1983: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & -8°.
Today was the day to climb to the big pasture. The temp. just right 
for the climb but on top I would find a cool breeze out of the southeast. 
Today I would try my ice creepers on my Sorel pacs. Soles are smooth 
so I would depend on the creepers for traction. Outgoing mail on the 
table and pin in the map I headed across for Falls Creek about ten 
o’clock. Snowshoes to timberline and then the climb that went better 
than expected. The creepers not as severe as crampons and in some ways 
better. Spikes on the crampons are long so apply leverage on your ankles 
when traveling steep ground.
February 25, 1983: 
Overcast, Calm & 14°.
Time to spare so I improved my brace chuck for the ice auger. Now 
it will take the shank of the auger stem willingly.
March 8, 1983: 
Clear, Calm & 0°. 
This afternoon I reworked one of my ice creepers and stitched a 
backstay on one of my shoe pacs. Dug under my lower bunk for my civi-
lized shoes that I haven’t had on for about three years. Shined them with 
silicone and laced them with new strings. March 19th will come too soon.

March 9, 1983: 
Clear, Calm & -8°.
First light came and I had nothing special planned for the day but 
I soon would have. -8° clear and dead calm – a perfect day to go to the 
Chili River and on down to the edge of the big flat. On top of a high 
gravel knoll there rests a big erratic rock. “Trap rock”, I call it for years 
back a rusty steel trap lay on it. Then it disappeared but the name trap 
rock stayed.
I went crunching down the ice on creepers. Crampons are too severe 
and it takes power to chip a stretch 16 miles long … My creepers not 
too sharp so there was a little slippage.
March 10, 1983: 
Clear, Calm & -18°. 
My ice creepers [G.I. crampons] were the first item of business when I 
started my working day. How to do a satisfactory job had used up some 
of my non-sleeping time last night. The thin spring steel strip that broke 
was one of four that positions and holds the spikes in the proper posi-
tion and the creeper in the proper shape to fit the boot. A small stove 
bolt forms the spike at the front. Two spaced wide behind it forming a 
triangle & proper adjustment. I lost that adjustment when the strip from 
the bolt to one of them broke. My plan was to cut a triangle from gas 
can tin to cover the bolt and both side spikes. A hole to allow bolting 
the point of the triangle with the existing bolt. A hole for each spike and

tabs extending to each side. The triangle of holes would hold the spikes 
in the proper position as the strip had done. The tabs bent up and over 
the top would be under my shoe pac and securing the rear corners of the 
triangle. Completed it looked like a professional job and just might last 
longer than the spring steel strip which broke, and I suspect, because I 
stepped on too many rocks. Anyway, I felt that the repair would be good 
for the 1983 spring ice season.
The temperature was climbing but slowly. I wrote letters till noon 
and it was zero at that time. After a bite to eat I would give my creepers 
the test so crossed the lake and climbed the trail to see what traffic had 
gone up or down … Back on this side I pronounced the creeper repair 
good for many a mile if I don’t abuse them on the rocks.
April 21, 1983: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & 18°.
Water beginning to show at the woodshed and I could prevent some 
of that mess by removing the snow from the roof. With the rake I raked 
it down within reach of the snow shovel and threw it aside.
January 10, 1984: 
Overcast, Blowing dn. & 30°.
I wanted to improve my king size snow shovel. I like the thing for 
it scoops a trail the width of my sled and wide enough to walk it on 
snowshoes. But the cutting edge was too flimsy. It warps from use and 
to push it, clearing a path, sees one corner climbing and the other dig-
ging. Gas can tin to the rescue. From a 16-inch by 21/4-inch strip folded 
in the center length wise I made a shoe to slip over the edge. Drilled 
a batch of holes for aluminum aircraft rivets and soon had a strong 
straight cutting edge. To use up the morning I removed the ice build up 
at the forks of the path to the woodshed and cache.
April 30, 1984: 
Overcast, Calm & 32°.
Ice creeper time may be past but I gave mine some needed attention. 
Flexible steel but flexing at 40 below gets to them eventually. They are 
good for many a mile again.
These U.S. Army lightweight G.I. crampons  were meant to be for short-
term use while not adding significant weight to a soldier’s pack. By constantly 
repairing them, Dick was able to use them far beyond their intended use.
August 28, 1984: 
Partly cloudy, Calm & 26°.
I had launched the canoe and on my way to Hope’s cabin to get my 
little pumpkin seed fiberglass sled to sled some gravel to a needed spot

Again 2 inches of snow and this morning I would go get my snow 
shovel. A real nice morning with the snow loading every twig and 
spruce bough. I had my spuds before heading for Hope’s cabin for a refill 
of rolled oats and the king size shovel. The snow lays about ten inches 
deep now. I was surprised that the shovel didn’t come front and center 
when I opened the door. It certainly wouldn’t be out of sight so it must 
be at Spike’s cabin so I plowed my way there. No, it wasn’t there and I 
was sure before I went. Where would it be that I wouldn’t remember 
seeing it. So, I trudged to check behind the woodshed. Years past I 
always tied it up under the back slope of the roof over the split wood. 
Last spring I had put it there again and now I faintly remembered mov-
ing it to a better place.
Imagine going into an Alaskan winter without a snow shovel. But, 
I doubt very much if Babe owned or used one in all his winters on Lake 
Clark. Big snowdrifts they just climbed over the top as many times a day 
as was necessary.
Had I intended to tie it up under the over hang of the roof behind 
the woodshed and laid it on the roof until such time that I got it done? 
No, I wouldn’t do that but I was ready to prospect the snow cover with 
the rake.
It had to be in Hope’s cabin so back I went and this time I moved 
a few items that might be hiding it. Wasn’t there for sure. Again I went

to Spike’s cabin and looked under the bed. If it wasn’t so big and heavy I 
would have blamed the robbers for packing it away. This trip I took a few 
pictures. Back home again and now I was thinking about making another 
one. I had a 15-gallon oil drum that Babe had left many years ago. This 
time I wouldn’t make it quite so king size but the width was good – just 
wide enough for snowshoes when leaving or returning to the cabin….
If I were building another snow shovel how would I change the 
design to make it strong but lighter? I went to the woodshed to see what 
I had for a handle. Some thing told me to look up. I did and there was 
my shovel no more than 16-inches above me. Now I remember where 
I had put it. I had tied it up under the roof poles on the front slope of 
the roof directly over the pathway through the woodshed. Every time I 
walked through I walked under it. So completely out of the way I doubt 
if many visitors saw it this summer. I took it down and used it to widen 
my swept pathways. All this monkey business took most of the morning.
November 25, 1984: 
Partly cloudy, Breeze dn. & 2°.
Before nightfall I went for a length of wood I had left across the 
creek yesterday and started the repair of my ice creepers. I would like 
new ones but I don’t see them listed this fall.
March 7, 1985: 
Partly cloudy, Blowing up & 2°. 
I knew that there would be a lot of shoveling to do so I had my fill of 
good hotcakes with the best syrup I have ever made (my opinion). Into 
it went brown sugar. A generous amount of butter flavored salt. Quite a 
batch of maplene, corn starch and flour. Boiled it longer than usual and it 
came out with a better color than previous batches. Hotcakes were good, 
even the robbers came back for 2nds, 3rds, 4ths & more.
I shoveled and packed scoops full on my big shovel for I have run 
out of room to stockpile the stuff. In front of the cache the snow five feet 
deep. In front of the cabin I climbed on top of the pile 3 times to shovel it 
back to make room for more. Beyond the cabin the drifting not too bad.
April 9, 1985: 
Partly cloudy, calm & -15°. 
The cabin was warm and I didn’t give the outside temp. much 
thought. Sure was a surprise to see it -15° this April 9th.
Every thing looking pretty good I walked my airstrip for plane day 
could be any day now, but I hope it doesn’t happen until the 14th. What 
I found was drifts across the strip and at least 6 of them that should be 
leveled. Perhaps he could land somewhere else but anywhere close was 
the same – scattered drifts with the up countryside steep and up to a 
foot high. The snow wind packed hard and I hardly made a track in it.

I started on the far end and with the no. 2 long handle I spaded it 
to get it semi loose and then tried the big snow shovel. The snow too 
heavy and it was hard to get the shovel into it. So, I spaded it and then 
chopped it fine with the no. 2. A no. 2 is a poor snow shovel but as a 
snow thrower it isn’t bad. Use it like a broom and then again and again 
if necessary to cover the area and get rid of the drift. I was half done by 
noon and had a blister coming in my right palm.
Dick used his “No. 2 long handle” as much in the winter (for moving ice 
and snow) as he did in the summer (for moving gravel and rocks). The num-
ber of photographs that include Dick’s long-handled No. 2, in both summer 
and winter, confirms its prominent place in his arsenal of tools.

No more need for the ice chisel and snow shovel I hope. The chisel I 
sharpened and put it up under the overhead in the woodshed. The snow 
shovel where it got lost last year but it needed some repairs. Raining a 
dampening rain as I cut metal drilled holes and hammered rivets. After 
I called it enough for today the rain did the same.

I got out my urethane and brush to complete my canoe paddle touch 
ups before putting them with the canoe. My snowshoes too got a second 
coat on the bottom side. They are 1942 model “Lunds” and look like 
new ones.
It is not known what happened to Dick’s Lund snowshoes. After measur-
ing Dick’s snowshoes by using historical photographs of them hanging above 
his fireplace mantle, I was able to purchase a pair of shoes matching those 
measurements and with the same shape.

After chores I took an hours walk down the left side. Didn’t wear 
creepers but it would have been a more pleasant walk if I had. I found a

bit of fresh over flow in places down near one-mile rock. Many springs 
feed into the lake down that side….
My dishwasher was getting pretty ratty so after lunch I made a new 
one from a sponge and Cast stocking (used in applying a plaster cast). To 
sew a cover on a sponge makes it much more durable.
I did some work on my ice creepers and then sawed and split 
enough to round out my woodpile … To finish the day before supper I 
lashed on my rebuilt creepers and took a walk down the center trail for 
11⁄ 2 miles.

I had a project to take care of while they bubbled. Last walk I had 
a creeper failure. G.I. creepers and they have seen several winters use. 
Metal fatigue has caused more than one failure. I would certainly order 
a new pair but I haven’t seen them advertised for years.

The going not too bad. Some good solid crust and some breakable. 
The lower lake looked very good but it would be creepers all the way and

Frost buttons were creeping up the door and I knew it was pretty 
cool outside. Daylight saw them to the bottom of the upper door.
… Near noon and then remembered my snowshoe harness (binding) 
needed a new wire loop to secure the heel strap.
I headed for one-mile rock and then up through the timber to tim-
berline … I was about half way when I heard an airplane coming. It didn’t 
have the super cub sound so it wouldn’t be Hollis. It was Glen’s Pacer and 
he saw me trudging along. He circled and landed not far behind me. I got 
off of my snowshoes and he stuffed them in on top of the load.
He [Glen Alsworth] had a heavy sack of spuds, a box of groceries and 
my sack of mail. We dumped it 
on the floor and started sorting. 
I got my new camera lens and 
from R.E.I. my instep crampons. 
It was Dec. 20th that my order 
went out.
Dick left two pairs of these 
Austrian crampons in Weisser’s 
cabin. Both have his signature heel 
strap and modified instep straps. 
One has been welded from a frac-
ture. Both pairs show prolonged use.

This afternoon I wanted to climb to the big pasture and see how 
many sheep I have. I hadn’t seen one for days.
Snowshoes to timberline where it was 35°. Climbing was very near 
snow free until I got on the hard wind pack in waterfall canyon. Today 
I was wearing my hikers and instep crampons. They are perfect for that 
climb. More comfortable than full length, much lighter and easier and 
quicker to put on and remove. Coming down the steep point of the 
mountain they are especially good. The tripping tendency of full-length 
crampons is eliminated. I would recommend them to anyone, even city 
folks if they have a mountain in view.
I wanted to come down the point of the mountain to give the new 
crampons a test and lucky that I did for I found 6 head of sheep making 
the total 38 head.
April 1, 1986: 
Partly cloudy, calm & -10°.
It was still a fair day with the sun weak due to a high thin overcast. 
I wanted to climb to the big pasture to see if the wolves had crossed to 
Emerson Creek valley.
I would come down the face and my sun check trail of last winter. 
The snowshoe trail would be packed and frozen. Again my instep cram-
pons paid for themselves. Down a very steep scree chute which had a 
good stretch of frozen wind pack. It would have been a struggle wearing 
only my hiking boots.

After chores I saw where I could improve my beach by using the 
old reliable Mexican No. 2 dragline. My shovel shows a lot of wear and 
Garry Pogany is a contractor. He was really interested in that No. 2 as 
if he had never seen one worn so badly. Its uneven wear indicated that I 
am a right-hander.
November 19, 1986: 
Fog overcast, Calm & 2°. 
I thought about going to check the lower lake. To sit here and 
not know what date the lower lake iced over would be a pretty sloppy 
operation. A breeze had come down the lake and I decided to climb the 
Cowgill trail above timberline and check the lake with the glasses. So I 
strapped on my good instep crampons and crossed the creek.

Nylon straps and patent metal buckles on the crampons. No tongue 
in the buckles and the cold nylon too stiff to hold by friction alone. They 
kept coming loose so when I got back I opened the machine shop on 
my newspaper covered table and proceeded to make a foolproof fas-
tener. I did by drilling a hole through the friction catch and pushing 
an aircraft rivet through from the bottom side. I epoxied it in place and 
then punched holes in the strap with a sharp awl. Epoxied the holes and 
kept them open until the glue set. Now its as simple as pulling the strap 
through using the appropriate hole over the rivet. Guaranteed never to 
fail on the mountain.

I was thinking that it would be a good idea to go check the ice of 
the Lower Lake. See how thick the ice was on Nov. 27th Thanksgiving 
day. I would travel the beach trail to stay away from the snow-laden 
brush. I had put my ice auger together and sharpened it but for the trip I 
would take my little double bit and the tape.
December 31, 1986: 
Nearly clear, Breeze dn. 30°.
It was a real nice morning, dead calm on this side of the point but a 
breeze down out in the long run. I would go down and check the lower 
lake just for the record, so I lashed my ice auger and gauging stick on the  
pack frame and trudged down the middle in 55 minutes to the lower shore.
January 7, 1987: 
Partly cloudy, Calm & 20°. 
My $10.00 broom took care of the snow on the pathways. I dragged 
my king size shovel to lie out an airstrip for Hollis [National Park Service 
pilot Hollis Twitchell] if he came today. Creek water is putting a lot of 
water under the snow so I put the airstrip farther out than in past years.
February 6, 1987: 
Partly cloudy, Blowing dn. & 26°.
I had an early lunch and loaded my ice auger and measuring stick on 
the light pack frame. I would measure the ice on the lower lake for the 
record.

Slept so sound my heart nearly stopped. Pulse rate was 54 this

time I know where my king size snow shovel is hiding and it may go 
into service soon.

I was anxious to learn how much ice we made in the last 24 hours 
so I took the ice auger out of storage in the woodshed and fitted it to the 
carpenters brace. The ice was very hard as very cold ice is. I suspected 
that my augers cutting edge needed sharpening and would first thing. 
My measuring stick said 2" in the last 24 hours.

Partly cloudy, Calm & 17°. 
The snow light and maybe three and a quarter or a half. It was a 
pleasure to clear my path system with my king size snow shovel. Ex. 
Gov. Jay inspected my snow shovel and said “you made this shovel from 
a small oil drum, I see”. When he came and walked up the cleared path 
to the lake he asked me if there is a Twin Lakes ordinance that says you 
shall clear your walkways. I wonder if he shovels any snow. Not much 
I’m sure and maybe none for they have little snow … I have never seen 
a snow shovel or a shoveled path at Port Alsworth. Climb over those 
drifts and again and again. Spring will take them away. Pilots don’t 
shovel snow.
March 3, 1988: 
Overcast, Blowing dn. 24° - Snowing.
Daylight and what a sight. In my sock feet I swept the snow to the 
side and beyond the end of my snow machine track doormat so I could 
poke the steel tape down and get an idea.
I had left my snowshoes inside to dry last night. After chores this 
morning I was going to hang them on their peg outside. I noticed one 
strand of my good heavy three eights neoprene filling broken square off 
as if cut by a knife. I could hardly believe it. On the under side and at 
the edge of the wooden crossbar behind my heel. Perhaps a sharp rock 
did it but I doubt it. Years back when I refilled the center sections I had 
about 31/2" more than I needed. I just left it instead of cutting it off. 
Now I did cut it and used it for making a splice. It and “barge” cement 
to make the splice and some of that good monofilament fish line for 
thread.
 More than 6" now and I cleared my road system. The snow so 
high along the trench that I was having trouble pitching the snow high 
enough with my king size snow shovel. So, after lunch I got on my 
snowshoes and on top of the ridge with the no. 2 long handle to work 
the ridge back and make room for more snow to come and it did with 
strong wind – a regular blizzard.
March 15, 1988: 
Clear, calm and -11°.
For this afternoon I had a project. I would make an alternation on 
 149
A Land of Snow & Ice
my big snow shovel. I would cut the lip back two inches and beef up the 
edge again. It wouldn’t hold as much snow but enough. To strengthen 
the cutting edge I doubled the thickness by turning a quarter inch of the 
edge under and back. My good heavy wedge was my anvil and my rock 
hammer made the crimp complete.
May 14, 1988: 
Partly cloudy, calm & 35°.
Middle of May and time to put the ice chisel and snow shovel away 
for another summer season. My shovel needed some minor repairs so I 
got out my tools and put it in shape for instant use when the snow comes.
June 1, 1988: 
Very few clouds, Calm & 32°.
Ideal weather and lake conditions for the trip to the Lofstedt cabin 
for the load I left there. Just as well do it before a breeze comes so I 
rolled out. The temp. 32° and it would be cool on the fingers. I tucked a 
“Shaklee” granola bar in my pocket and was off and paddling at 02:45. 
There was very little ice above Carrithers point. Mostly it was ice with 
a load of avalanche snow. The rising lake level had free’d the ice from 
shore. It was a good paddle for the first one of the season and I could 
feel it in my shoulders. One hour and fifteen minutes from my beach to 
the head of Lofstedt bay. My sled, spuds, brown sugar and mail aboard 
I headed back down and still a flat calm lake. While I was there the sun 
cleared Center mt. so I had the sun on my back. Travel time was about 
the same. An hour ten to Carrithers point where I left the sled. Six 
o’clock here and I started breakfast.
May 20, 1988: 
Partly cloudy, Calm & 35°.
Coming down the beach I stopped at Hope’s cabin and got my 
home made rotten ice snowshoes [skis]. I would try them here and maybe 
use them going up the lake. 
October 13, 1988: 
Overcast, Calm and 13°.
Back here I improved my instep crampons to make them more reli-
able. I had changed the binding arrangement to prevent chafing of the 
straps but didn’t keep them in place as well.
Jan. 27, 1989: 
Clear, Calm and -78°.
At nine, three and six I fed the fire but ice came to both water 
buckets and pretty strong. I had to break it before I could pour water 
from the plastic bucket. After seeing it a -72° when I called it a day I just 
wouldn’t hazard a guess as to what it would be come morning. Certainly

not 80 below but it was so close I couldn’t be sure if it was -79 or 80 so 
I made it a -78° due to liquid in the tube separating a bit at the very top 
of the red. I just couldn’t believe that it could get so cold at Twin Lakes. 
After chores I went out on the lake to experience real cold. It was colder, 
the air had a bite to it, and it had better be dead calm or it would burn 
like dry ice.
Well now! What is causing this very unusual cold and how long will 
it last? From the 12 Jan. to the 28th now and all readings except two 
below zero and nearly all of them pretty far down the scale. The morn-
ing reading average for the past five days has been a -55° and I thought a 
-44° was cold.
So now at 8:30 we are headed in to another night of preventing frost 
damage to my perishables.
In a letter to me, dated April 1, 1989, Dick wrote, “…the cold set in Jan. 
12th and ended Feb. 1st. The last two weeks of Jan had a morning ave. temp 
of -48.8° and from Jan. 24 for seven days a -58° ave. Was fortunate to have 
a -90° reading thermometer for I saw it a -78°. Not official of course and I 
would like to see how it compares with a weather service thermometer. At 
-80° the red did start to separate at that temperature. I wish I could report 
that my cabin was cozy warm but you know it wasn’t. But no pipes frozen 
and no fruit or vegetable due to being elevated and as stove at night and 
me stoking the fire 3-4 times a night. Strong ice in the water bucket several 
mornings. Here at the table writing I had my sleeping bag warmer hot rocks 
laying on the table by my writing hand. Great sport and I am glad I was here 
to experience some Siberian cold.”
October 15, 1989: 
Overcast, Lt. Breeze up and 27°. 
From the door I learned it had snowed and quite a lot. My steel tape 
made it 51/2" out front. It had been dead calm and every bough and 
twig was bending under the load. It would have to go untouched until 
after breakfast.
Dishes done I tried the good broom but the snow was too heavy and 
I went to the woodshed for the king size snow shovel in storage over 
head in the passageway. I thought of the first good snow several yrs. ago 
and me wondering what I had done with my shovel last spring. It was 
about 09:15 before I got the roads plowed out.
October 16, 1989: 
Overcast, Lt. Breeze dn. 20°.
I came home to make some sheet metal plates to beef up my snow shovel.
To make sheet-metal plates Dick used a section of the barrel’s rib, likely 
what remained from making his shovel 21 years earlier. He drilled 1/8" holes 
and used rivets to attach the plates over the metal-fatigue cracks. Eight 
unused holes make me think the plate covering the longest metal-fatigue crack 
 151
A Land of Snow & Ice
eventually failed and when he put on a second plate, he put it on closer to the 
outer edge of the blade.
The hardware holding the spruce handle and 15-gallon drum metal parts 
together are a collection of what Dick had on hand. They include a few nails, 
regular bolts and nuts, bolts with self-locking nuts, rivets, and used aircraft 
sheet-metal screws that were cut off then hammered to make rivets.
Dick’s snow shovel and ice cleats are now in the National Park Service 
archives in Anchorage. I’ve made replicas to take their place at Dick’s cabin.

Chapter 2
Replicating the shovel’s 9" metal-branching-fatigue crack to within 1/8" was 
both challenging and rewarding. Every hardware fastener exactly matches 
what Dick used and every empty rivet hole is exactly placed. My goal was to 
leave none of me in the reproduction but everything I could of Dick, including 
the patina on the shovel’s handle. 
I was once talking about Dick’s snow shovel to a group of visitors, includ-
ing Alan Bennett who had visited Dick in winter on numerous occasions 
as the first wildlife biologist for Lake Clark National Park. Alan remarked, 
“Maybe more interesting than the shovel was Dick’s trench. What astounded 
me about his shoveling style was that the width of the paths, which extended 
from cabin to water hole to airstrip to cache to woodshed and beyond, precisely 
conformed to the width of his snow shovel, no matter how deep the snow. 
When most people shovel they occasionally take a bite from the side of the 
berms or impulsively widen it here and there. Not Dick. The sides of his berms 
were clean cut, vertical, and always the width of that shovel.”
I found the top of a 15-gallon steel drum hanging on the back of the wood-
shed where Dick left it years before. It had the appearance of a cookie cutter 
Dick’s pair of cleats and the cookie cutter drum-top I found 
hanging on the back of Dick’s woodshed. (Photo by Monroe

with a cold chisel to make his cleats. (Photo by K. Schubeck)

A Land of Snow & Ice
and the shape of the cookies matched Dick’s handcrafted ice crampons (what 
Dick called “cleats”). When I looked at the jagged edges along the cookie-cutter 
drum top, I imagined Dick had cut the base plate of the crampons using tin 
snips, with each serration of the cut representing a single squeeze of the tin 
snips. Just before Dick’s snow shovel and cleats were taken to the National 
Park Service archives, I made replicas, using the 15-gallon drum Dick was 
likely close to using when he could not find his snow shovel. Acquiring a 
replacement barrel to have at Dick’s cabin would allow future visitors to see 
the exact type of barrel Dick used to cut the blade for his snow shovel and for 
the sole of his cleats. I cut the metal with tin snips. 
A few years later I was explaining to a group of visitors, including Alvin 
Pierce, how Dick had cut the parts. Alvin, who knew Dick well, looked at 
the cookie-cutter drum top and suggested that Dick had used a cold chisel and 
hammer with the drum top resting on the end of a spruce log. One more look 
at the cookie cutter convinced me Alvin was correct.
Dick made the seven cleats he attached to the sole of each crampon from 
the same heavy drum metal the sole was made from. Dick probably started to 
bend each cleat to shape using pliers, and then hammered the cleat to a tight 
fold using a heavy piece of metal for an anvil. After drilling two holes through 
each cleat and the sole using an eggbeater drill, he screwed used aircraft sheet-
metal screws up from the bottom, cut them proud of the sole and hammered the 
cut end on his anvil, effectively making a non-removable rivet. 
Replicating the crampons in 2011, I could not find screws to match the 
screws Dick used. Two years later, in a conversation with Dick’s brother 
Raymond, I spoke of not being able to find any small, slotted, steel sheet-
metal screws. I had forgotten if the screws were #4 or #6.  Raymond said 
they were #4 aircraft sheet-metal screws. He remembered having sent them 
to Dick when Dick made the crampons in 1968.  Raymond sent me a small 
supply of used #4 and #6 aircraft sheet-metal screws, and a packet of vintage 
rivets in a tiny box, along with a note and peppermint candies for K. and me. 
Raymond and Dick remained close over the years. Raymond was a 
continuing support to Dick throughout Dick’s years at Twin Lakes. Dick 
Proenneke’s story at Twin Lakes is not complete without Raymond. In 1999, 
Dick moved from Twin Lakes to live with Raymond in Hemet, California. 
I remember Raymond for his sharp mind and exceptional level of thoughtful-
ness, and as a remarkable craftsman. 
November 21, 1989: 
Overcast, Blowing dn. 12°. 
In the night I heard wind and lots of it. Which direction was it 
from? I wondered … A big wind would move a lot of snow. So, for the 
remainder of the night it was the cache ladder and the hanging snow 
shovel that said this was not just an ordinary wind.
August 31, 1990: 
Partly cloudy, Breeze up & 40°.

Chapter 2
Many rocks had been exposed [on the beach in front of Dick’s cabin] 
and I removed all of them I could with the old badly worn no. 2 shovel.
December 4, 1990: 
Partly cloudy, Calm and -19°. 
Coming back I decided to improve my instep crampons. Make them 
easier to put on and remove. That I did.
December 9, 1990: 
Clear, Calm, & -11°.
Ready for the days project before daylight came. I would see if I 
could improve those G.I. ice creepers by eliminating that slippery heel. 
That problem had used up some of my sleeping time. Looking for some-
thing to use and I came up with the wire handle for an aviation gas can. 
Good heavy tough to bend wire. Two claws for the heel was my think-
ing. The handle 8" long when straightened out. Bend it 90°, 5/16" on 
each side of center. Cross the two legs 1⁄2" from the bends. Then a bit of 
a reverse bend to position the ends under the heel. Bend the tips down 
1⁄4" from the ends and there it was ready to install. Open the creepers 
adjustment and thread the loop of my little Jim dandy back to the legs in 
the adjusting strip that takes the short length of chain. Lash the adjust-
ment and the job was complete … In case it was a good idea that was a 
complete failure I would only do one and give it a good test. So I went 
to Hope’s cabin for my big sled and hauled wood from the far end of 
the beach beyond the mouth of Hope Creek. Three loads came in and it 
stood the test of pulling a load but I didn’t have slick ice. I would cross 
the lake and climb to the sun on my blazed trail of two years ago when I 
climbed so often to film old Limpy and her triplets.
January 6, 1991: 
Clear, Calm and 0°.
11:00 when I left the cabin with the fire banked for hours of 
absence. Snowshoes and full crampons [from Erv Terry] on the light 
pack frame. Instep crampons [Austrian] for the lake ice crossing. 
Snowshoes for the climb to timber line. There, I left the excess gear and 
strapped on the full crampons for the climb up the point of the mt. I 
was soon in the sun and looked for sign of melting. Against a rock face 
it was sure to be making water. 
Doing better with my heavy hikers being rough shod and the boots 
were more comfortable than in many years. The climb went well and I 
topped out on the point along side waterfall canyon of Falls creek in just 
about 2 hrs. from my cabin. The big pasture solid white and smooth. No 
sheep could live there and where would they be? I thought maybe they 
were around behind Falls peak and up slope from Emerson creek. 
Two o’clock when I stood on the point ready to drop down to timber 
line. Lots of ice so watch it! A bad spill on that steep slope might make 
it slow getting to the cabin if that was possible. To timber line in 1⁄ 2 hr. 
 155
A Land of Snow & Ice
Back to snowshoes to the lake then instep crampons on the ice. It was 
exactly one hr. 10 minutes to my cabin from the point of the mt. 2000 
feet above the lake. 
March 24, 1992: 
Overcast, Breeze up and 24°.
I took my sled out for I felt sure they would have the 5 gal. of honey 
aboard. It was the first cargo unloaded. Glad to see it and I will have 
honey for a year and more.
June 4, 1992: 
Overcast, Breeze dn. and 42°.
This morning I would urethane my snowshoes – get them ready for 
over the mantle display. I wish I knew how many miles I have walked 
on that same pair. Used them every winter I have stayed at Twin Lakes 
and often in spring and fall when I didn’t.
I had just completed my project including canoe paddles, canoe tran-
som, and a few touch up jobs when I heard an airplane down country.
December 17, 1992: 
Overcast, Snowing – Calm & 25°.
I thought, “you poor miserable brush rat, you had better be in shape 
to move lots of snow come morning” … Ten inches of snow is a lot if 
you have an area to clear. To just shovel a single shovel width path is bad 
enough. So I pushed snow with my hoe rake and shoveled with my king 
size shovel. Lunchtime came and I had a couple hours work to do before 
calling it good for now.
March 15, 1993: 
Clear, Calm and -8°.
Clear and stars looking down, it could get pretty cool tonight. The 
half gallon carton of vanilla ice cream set on the table out front and 
morning would find it about right for dishing it out. Zero degrees makes 
soft ice cream. 
The fire was buried the whole night. I would have coals but puny 
ones. During breakfast I knew what I was going to do today. A good 
day to circle the mt. I had suggested it to Leon [Alsworth] and he said we 
will have to go on snowshoes. Maybe next week he could go but I was 
sure he wouldn’t. On those little Sherpa aluminum and plastic snow-
shoes I wouldn’t go. Only thing good about them is the ice claws for mt. 
travel. It was 9:30 when I closed the door. I would pack my snowshoes 
to the mouth of Low Pass creek. I had the Olympus OM1n with 50 and 
28 mm lens. I was dressed cool for it would be a warm three hrs getting 
to the divide. That last 400 feet of elevation is as steep as a cows face. 
I took a few frames from the mouth of Low Pass creek and then 
headed for the pass. No sign of porkypines at their winter home and 
now I wouldn’t know where to find one. I see no tracks. 
156 
	
Chapter 2
I was breaking a deeper trail than I had expected. It would be a 
good climb up the trench to the pass. Old tracks of a wolverine headed 
or coming from the pass. I have seen porky pines in the pass making 
that slow hike to the Kijik country. In due time I was up there enjoying 
the view back down and across the lake. Lots of snow up there and I 
believe there is more snow in the bottom behind gold ridge than I have 
ever seen there. 1,700 feet from the lake is the gain in elevation when 
you climb to the pass. From the pass it is a gain of 1,300 feet to the 
summit where I would cross. No tracks not one as I traveled on. The 
fresh last snow laid like a cotton bat and about 6 inches deep on top of 
the settled snow pack. Just before I got to that last very steep pitch to 
the divide I came to a reasonably fresh wolf track coming down from 
the high ridge. Later I would see that track climbing up 1st canyon. So 
wolves cross there some times and so do wolverine for today I would see 
a wolverine track climbing to the 3,000 ft. ridge. 
At last I stood at the base of that 400 ft. very steep climb. I would 
have to climb it without snowshoes so I put them on the light pack 
frame with my camera gear. The snow more than shoe pac deep but a 
base that was soft enough to give good traction. Traverse back and forth 
across a width of a couple hundred feet of the mt. Climb at a comfort-
able angle. Slow but steady does it and in due time I was up near the eye 
in the mt. I had looked for it as I climbed from Low Pass but couldn’t 
spot it. I found the snow so deep only a little of the eye was visible. At 
last I stood on the divide and the time a quarter till three. It had taken 
me more than five hrs from my cabin to the top 3,000 ft. up. 
The sun was bright and a cool breeze had me looking for sun on the 
protected side of the ridge. I shot a few frames and ate my sourdough 
sadwich and one of Sis’s good cookies. Now it was down hill all the way 
to my cabin and about 2 hrs. steady going to get there. Steep for the 
1st quarter mile. Now I learned what I once knew. Crampons can be 
necessary for that 1st quarter for the snow can be too hard to kick steps. 
Right there I should have turned back and down where I had climbed. 
I expected it to get better a hundred feet down. There is hard wind pack 
near the top. To play it safe I moved in the clear of rock outcrops below. 	
To lose footing and go pell mell down a steep pitch and hit a rock will 
spoil your day, but good. I was in the clear but footing was poor. If I 
started I wouldn’t stop for about 200 yds. And I started. I was using 
both hands on my good walking stick for a brake. Faster and faster and 
it was a pretty rough slide. My pack kept me from staying on my back 
and when I went side wise I started to roll. Ho Boy! All I could see 
was snow and blue sky revolving at a terrific rate. Presently I slowed 
and stopped. It had been the six inches of loose snow I was expecting 
higher up. It is surprising how much snow gets inside a tumble down 
the mt. My mittens were full. Snow inside my jacket. Didn’t lose my 
Bean cap with the ear flaps over my ears. Still had my pack on for I had 
 157
A Land of Snow & Ice
hooked the rubber link across my chest. First thing I noticed was that 
my right upper arm pained a little. If it hurt so soon it wouldn’t hurt a 
lot more tomorrow. Legs were ok and that was good. If I had broken 
a leg it would be “sorry charley” you didn’t make it. Tonight would be 
well below zero. So I could put up with a sore arm and not complain. 
I discovered that I had lost my good walking stick. I looked for sign of 
it above and below. Even tried to climb but after climbing 50 feet I slid 
down 25. Tried again and just couldn’t get traction. So I got organized 
and headed down the mt. in the loose 6-8 inches of snow. When the 
incline flattened a bit I put on my snowshoes and came down the water 
course from the base of the steep going. I hadn’t gone far when I met 
a wolf track climbing to the divide. It was short steps and feet making 
drag marks in the loose snow for the wolf. Headed for the Kijik for I 
hadn’t seen tracks in the pass coming to the upper lake. Down, down 
but not so steep that I would lose control on snowshoes. At times I 
would support my right arm with my left hand. It was uncomfortable 
hanging free. Lower I came to a wolverine track climbing so it was 
going over the top. I find mr. wolverine just doesn’t seem to care how 
steep or rough it is. He doesn’t seem to appreciate an easy route. 
Hope creek at last and from 1st canyon down it was nice going. 
Wished for my walking stick but managed without it. It was going to 
take just about 2 hrs. from the divide to my cabin and the sun would be 
just about ready to set directly behind the Pyramid mt. 
I opened the cabin door and learn’d Leon had been here. A bag con-
taining letters a package and two batteries for my Bendix “King” radio. I 
still had a very few coals under the ashes and fine stuff would have a fire 
going quickly. I wanted to auger the ice this evening for I might not do 
it so easy tomorrow. I found it 27" this 15th of March. Did my chores 
with little difficulty and got out of my damp hiking clothes. How would 
my journal entry go with that gimpy right arm. It has worked better 
but I managed better than I expected. I’ll take an “Ascription” at ladder 
climbing time. Now 10:30 Clear, calm and -3°. 
March 16, 1993: 
Partly cloudy, Calm and -24°.
I was busy reading mail and opening my package from brother 
Ray – Time went quickly and it was past midnight before I climbed the 
ladder. By staying up late I figured I would sleep better. I did sleep about 
three hours before I woke up. My gimpy arm didn’t want to move. No 
pain or little if it laid still. I slept till seven and this morning I would 
have a quick mush breakfast then give my upper arm and shoulder some 
hot towels. I think I am always in too much of a hurry to get an injury 
healed. I hadn’t been five minutes into my hot treatment when I heard 
a cub, low and close. It was the Park Service cub that stopped out front.

Chapter 2
Had Leon come to see if I had returned from my route the mt. tour? If 
I wasn’t here no doubt he would fly my route for I had left a note on the 
table. If he did fly he would be too late to do me any good for with the 
-24° I would be gone from this world. He had Al Bennet with him and 
asked me if I would like to go for a hike. They had time for a six hour 
hike. I certainly hadn’t planned to hike anywhere today but except for 
my arm I felt good enough to circle the mt. again. I told them about my 
escapade yesterday and of losing my walking stick. Leon said “we could 
climb and get it.” Al said, “you can but I prefer my kicking to be on 
more level ground.” We would go up Hope Creek and decide when we 
got to the first canyon. So, I wormed my way into my jacket and tucked 
a couple granola bars in a pocket. I was ready. Maybe the exercise would 
loosen up my arm a bit. We marched right along and when we got to the 
first canyon I said “This is the point of decision.” Leon was in the lead 
and went straight on up Hope Creek and I was glad. I wasn’t anxious to 
climb for that fool stick today. We walked into a breeze coming down 
the creek and it felt warm. They said it had been about 25° above at their 
cruising altitude coming to Twin Lakes. The snow got a little deeper as 
we reached upper Hope Creek. We stopped when we reached the “grave 
yard of the stones”.
May 7, 1993: 
Partly cloudy, Calm 28°.
First item of business was to check the spooky ice. It had to be safe 
for it was yesterday morning. This time I would do it right. I went to 
Hopes cabin for a life vest and I brought my big rotten ice skis along. 
On the ice besides my auger and gauging stick I packed a long dry 
balsam poplar pole. Just pretty difficult to get into serious trouble if you 
have a pole. It will get you out on top and then if need be you can crawl 
and push it ahead of you to help support your weight on the ice. There 
was a crust this morning. The cub on 30" tires would have no problem. 
The ice candled to the bottom and 22 inches thick. Lost one inch yester-
day. If Leon came I would tell him of my damp feet yesterday and then 
tell him I would buy him a new cub if he broke through the ice here but 
do not and I repeat do not land on the lower half of this lake even with 
30 inch tires.
May 12, 1993: 
Partly cloudy, Blowing dn. and 37°.
I checked the ice for the last time – at least far out. The auger just 
rattled down through and out the bottom 19" the gauge stick said. Now 
and again a soft step when I walked on it. Don’t worry, I was wearing a 
life vest and packing my poplar pole. In close where I got on the ice it 
was 14" but hard ice, not candled. Later I wished I had brought in the 
ribbon-decorated bush I had planted at Leon’s parking spot. So I put  
 159
A Land of Snow & Ice
on my homemade rotten ice skis and went out to get it. I could nearly  
walk on a lake filled or covered with ice cubes with those super skis.
Dick’s “big rotten ice skis,” along with several pairs of crampons, have 
been stored in Weisser’s cabin since Dick departed Twin Lakes. If visitors were 
interested, I would walk with them to see these artifacts. 
There are only a few inches of feathering of the wood grain on the bottom 
of each end of the skis, so I thought it was likely that Dick did not use these 
skis very much. 
Now having access to Dick’s journals I know how wrong I was. The 
little feathering is due to Dick sanding the feathered bottoms and applying 
additional varnish as needed so the skis never showed much use. I had never 
noticed the holes from Dick driving nails through the skis for additional trac-
tion on May 26, 1975. Dick’s spruce skies now take their rightful place in 
understanding his handcrafted life. Dick left all of these items in Weisser’s 
cabin because that was their home during the summer when he was not using 
them. 
Dick essentially had the use of his own cabin and three other cabins for 
storage and guests to stay in. The items that make up Dick’s winter gear, even 
though Dick left them in Weisser’s cabin, were as important as the things he 
left at his cabin. I hope more of Dick’s winter gear would be available at his 
cabin for visitors in the future.
November 18, 1993: 
Overcast, Snowing, Calm and 20°.
So, I moved snow and the breeze came and picked up to blow up 
lake. By 10:00 I had it done for now but could have started over.
At 3 PM I went to check the log. 51/2" inches in the past 24 hrs. 
It made about 27/100 inch of water. I shoveled snow until dark and only 
half done. Almost never does nightfall catch me with my snow removal 
so far behind.
November 6, 1994: 
Overcast, Calm and 20°.
Snow, nearly 6 inches to move and again I removed a bunch of 
offending roots that cause my king size shovel to stop suddenly. My 
home made shovel has given good service all these years. Doubt that I 
will need another.
Dick did not need another snow shovel to complete his years at Twin 
Lakes. He left his snow shovel fully repaired and ready to shovel snow.
December 11, 1994: 
Overcast, Blowing down and 27°.
A sweepable snow had come – maybe 1/4" and more would start 
about noon. I made a few small repairs and wrote a letter of thanks to 
Bob Swerer for the new ice creepers.

Chapter 2
I found these crampons stored in Weisser’s cabin. They appear to be unused. 
Dick made, used and repaired many sets of crampons of various styles. Bob 
Swerer told me he sent them after receiving a letter from Dick about hitting 
his head on the ice in a hard fall. 
Dick came to Twin Lakes prepared for living in the remote Alaskan 
wilderness. Remaining prepared throughout the next three decades included 
thoughtful acts like this from Dick’s many friends.
August 10, 1995: 
Partly Cloudy, Blowing up and 38°. 
 The wind was backing off a bit and my beach needed me and my 
long handled no. two. My poor old shovel is about worn out after about 
36-37 years at Twin Lakes. Years back a California contractor thought it 
was the most worn out shovel he had ever seen.
I found the blade of an old shovel leaning against a spruce near Dick’s 
woodshed during my first summer at Twin Lakes – but only the blade. It had 
three metal-fatigue cracks in the places a long-used shovel blade typically gets 
metal-fatigue cracks. The blade had been worn several inches shorter than 
when it was new and the wear was asymmetrical. I assumed the blade was 
Dick’s but other than tickling my curiosity I had no way of learning much 
about it.
As tour guides, K. and I were frequently asked about items we knew little 
or nothing about other than they likely belonged to Dick. The old shovel blade 
was one of these. There were as many items in this category as the ones we 
knew about. I was tirelessly curious to learn more about every tool and hand-
crafted item left at Dick’s cabin. Communicating with visitors continually 
added to what was collectively known.
In 2009, Kathryn ‘Katie’ Myers, National Park Service museum cura-
tor, made a photographic inventory of the belongings still remaining at Dick’s 
cabin. She asked what the story was on the rusted shovel blade. Looking at the 
blade, I thought it might fit an old T-shovel handle I found leaning against 
Weisser’s cabin years earlier. The handle’s T was tightly wired to where the 
handle had been broken. The T-shovel handle made a perfect fit in the socket 
of the shovel blade Katie asked about. The original rivet hole aligned through 
both blade and handle. From that moment on I knew this old handle and 
blade had an amazing story to tell if only they could speak. The extreme short-
ening and asymmetry of the blade before it was retired from metal-fatigue 
cracks told me Dick used this shovel with extreme finesse even as he worked it 
hard. I did not have access to Dick’s journals but assumed the T-handle had 
been a temporary fix before Dick could have a new handle flown to Twin 
Lakes. I knew the metal-fatigued blade had lived a very long and hard life 
after Dick removed it from T-handle. I wanted to find the handle that had 
lived with the metal-fatigued blade before it too had been removed. I moved 
the T-shovel handle from Weisser’s cabin and kept it with the metal-fatigued 
blade in Dick’s woodshed for visitors to see.

A Land of Snow & Ice
A shovel blade will normally develop metal-fatigue cracks long before its 
length shortens even half an inch from use. I knew Dick used his shovel as a 
prying tool and often to pry heavy rocks. The life he got from the shovel blade 
remains a marvel beyond my belief. I have never seen anything like it. It 
speaks volumes about how Dick used his tools. Growing up with livestock 
on a small farm that fed our family, my childhood education included the 
caretaking of the tools I used. I learned to get the job done without breaking 
handles. A long-handled No. 2 was one of those tools. Various No. 2s have 
played an oversized role in my life, more than enough to know Dick’s shovel 
tells a significant story about its user. More than a few visitors to Dick’s cabin 
each summer would carefully examine both the blade and T-handle as we 
speculated about the shovel’s history with Dick.
When K. arrived at Twin Lakes in 2000 she took video while walking 
around Dick’s cabin and the surrounding area. Two shovels hung on the out-
side of Dick’s cabin. I did not pay them much attention except to move both of 
them into Dick’s woodshed since neither seemed like shovels Dick would have 
had at his cabin. The blade of one was so badly burned, warped and without 
stiffness that it was worthless as a shovel. The other was a firefighter-style 
shovel that matched a shovel at the ranger cabin on Lower Twin Lakes. The 
one with the burned blade was still at Dick’s woodshed when I left in 2018. I 
presume the firefighter shovels were flown to Twin Lakes and left there by the 
National Park Service.
When I began writing this book, I looked at the shovel with the burned 
blade with renewed scrutiny. The handle on this shovel was not the shov-
el’s original handle. The handle had patches of wood finish, not the handle’s 
original finish but finish from a person who took care of his tools. There were 
scratches from Dick rasping the end of the handle – to make it fit in the socket of 
the blade that was now burned. Through the rasping marks I could see where 
the handle had perfectly fit the socket of the metal-fatigued blade Dick left 
under a spruce near his woodshed. The sockets on the old metal-fatigued blade 
and the burned blade were very different, requiring the rasping. Dick put the 
handle of his metal-fatigued No. 2 on this blade before it was burned as no one 
would put this well-cared-for handle on an already worthless blade. Despite 
the intense heat that burned the lower half of the shovel’s blade there was no 
heat scarring on the handle, so only the end of the blade had been left in fire.
With access to Dick’s journals in 2017 my first search was for every time 
Dick used the word “shovel”. A story about this shovel and about Dick started 
coming to light. His journals tell of the Carrithers bringing him a new handle 
for his No. 2 in 1967. He journaled a few weeks earlier of removing a spruce 
stump from his building site. Dick likely broke the shovel’s handle removing 
that sizable stump though he did not write about it in his journal. He likely did 
not want to write about breaking a handle – I know I am disappointed with my 
misjudgment every time I break a handle. Dick likely fashioned the T-handle 
to complete the job of removing the stump. The crosspiece of the T-handle is still 
strongly fastened but this fix would not have held up to years of use. 
162 
	
Chapter 2
It took me three days to read every “shovel” entry Dick made throughout 
his years at Twin Lakes. His journal entry above, August 10, 1995, “My poor 
old shovel is about worn out…” likely implies the blade had finally developed 
metal-fatigue cracks. Dick commented how badly his old shovel was worn in 
a journal entry 9 years earlier. I’m sure he continued to put it to heavy use 
throughout those years without over-stressing the handle or the blade. Dick 
did not journal about removing the second handle of his “long handled No. 2” 
but it was sometime after this 1995 journal entry. His 1995 entry was near 
the time he stopped journaling – to only write a short entry on his calendar 
each day. When Dick left the old metal-fatigued blade under a spruce, only 8" 
of the blade’s initial 11" length remained.
During my years at Twin Lakes, I did not want to believe the shovel 
with the burned blade was Dick’s since it was in such a sorry condition – even 
though I knew it was. I never talked about it to visitors. If Dick or someone 
helping him burned the shovel blade it was near the time he departed Twin 
Lakes – when he did not have the energy to replace the burned blade. If Dick 
had burned the blade of his shovel to this state of worthlessness he would not 
have left it hanging on the outside of his cabin – he would have put it behind 
his woodshed.
K. first met Dick in 1997, which I write more about in Chapter 7. Phil 
Caswell, a botanist, worked several summers making an inventory of plants 
in the new Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. While working at remote 
locations with brown bears, federal agencies required staff to have a backup 
person who was proficient with a 12-gauge shotgun. From 1995 through 
1999, K. volunteered as Phil’s backup person first at the Togiak National 
Wildlife Refuge and later at Lake Clark National Park where she met Dick. 
She spent her summers, while not teaching school in Eskimo villages in south-
west Alaska, hiking and identifying plants in wilderness not often visited. 
When in 1999 Dick Proenneke was not able to stay at his cabin for the 
summer, the National Park Service stationed a series of persons to stay close 
to his cabin. Phil and K. spent two weeks inventorying plants close to Dick’s 
cabin while seeing that the cabin was left alone. Dick did not live in his 
cabin again – it remained unoccupied for more than a year before I arrived in 
2000. There is no doubt persons camped in and around Dick’s cabin during 
that time, as the park service did not have a presence at Twin Lakes other 
than during the summer season. I believe it was then that Dick’s No. 2 was 
misused and burned and put back on the wall of Dick’s cabin where he had 
left it – much like his snow shovel had been borrowed and then damaged, and 
like a few instances when K. and I had to intervene when campers borrowed 
things from Dick’s cabin. I believe the National Park Service saw the useless 
shovel and brought a firefighter shovel and placed it on Dick’s cabin wall in 
the event there was a need.
Meticulously replicating Dick’s snow shovel and reading his journals, I 
have a sense for Dick’s engineering, his use of the shovels and his repairs. I 
have as much appreciation for Dick’s long-handled No. 2  and his snow shovel 
 163
A Land of Snow & Ice
as anything in Dick’s cabin. When one understands Dick’s purposeful way of 
living through any one of his tools or handcrafted items then his relationship 
with his tools, his handcraft and the wilderness around Twin Lakes comes 
more clearly into focus.
Nothing shows Dick’s handcrafted life, his use, care and repairs, more 
clearly than his No. 2 – the life and value of which  he documented with 
hundreds of journal entries. It is my hope that the National Park Service will 
take the No. 2 with the burned blade to the archives in Anchorage and replace 
it with a replica. The socket of the replica should match the socket of the burned 
blade and the replica’s handle should come from a shovel matching Dick’s 
worn, metal-fatigued blade – rasped to fit. The handle should be given spots 
of patinated varnish to simulate the care and use of Dick’s handle. Having 
this replica hanging on Dick’s cabin wall along with the metal-fatigued blade 
and its T-handle at his woodshed would allow visitors to understand Dick 
Proenneke’s use, care and repair of his tools more clearly than any other item at 
his cabin. I would be honored to make, for future visitors, a replicated version 
of the No. 2, which I believe Dick left at his cabin.

Chapter 2
May 15, 1996: 
Clear, Calm and very mild.
I would go to the post office [In Port Alsworth] for mail, Park Service 
actually for they collect it.
Back to Glen’s [Alsworth] to find Jim [Chaplin] fueling the little 
Stinson. He was flying 350 lbs. of provisions in for Pete [Guzman], the 
new boy, at “Twin Lakes.” So we flew and it was a good morning.
No wind and he wouldn’t land on the lower lake ice not knowing 
how good it was. Here was the only place we knew that was safe. I told 
him to off load the 350 lbs. here and Pete and I would get it down to 
Emerson quick enough. So we landed here to find the ice still good. 
Better here than I would see it today. We loaded all 350 lbs. on my little 
sled. I could tow it wearing ice creepers but towing it 3 miles would be 
something else. When I got away from the good ice I couldn’t make 
any time and offloaded two boxes. Went a quarter and left another one. 
Finally got there to find him waiting on the beach. The ice was not 
good. He waded out to the ice and packed the two 50 lb. boxes, one at 
a time, ashore plus 2 gallons of fuel for his stove. I told him to come 
up with me and we would get the boxes I had left. So he walked the 
beach until he found a place to get onto the ice. It seemed like a long 
three miles to me. I had been going pretty steady since reveille yesterday 
morning. Due to the bad ice down at Emerson we decided to sled this 
load to Titus Point and he could backpack them down the beach from 
there. Here I loaned him my G.I. packboard to take a load down as he 
went to camp. We came ashore a few minutes here and then with two 
towlines on the sled we walked across.

November 17, 1968:
A little tour this afternoon. Up the far side of Hope Creek to the 
gorge to prospect for long straight poles 4 to 6 inches through at the butt 
to use in building a cache in case I decide to and I probably will. Plenty 
of them there and it wouldn’t take many. With the creek iced over it 
would be no problem to slide them down.
November 18, 1968: 
Such fine weather to work. I would cut a bunch of good heavy poles, 
peel them and let them season till next spring. The wind was still strong 
but had little effect where I would be working. Starting at the far end, 
I looked them over and cut until noon. Now they lay at the bottom of 
the high bank. After lunch I took my drawknife and tripod stand for 
peeling. I worked until dark and had thirteen peeled. A count on those 
remaining as I came down – seven left – twenty in all. A real good start 
but not enough. 
November 23, 1968: 
Small detail day – do some work on my tripod. Fix the stove 
draught door for better regulation. Make a pan cover for my bean kettle 
(one with a fancy knob handle).
I would gather a few more heavy poles. I cut and peeled five and 
packed them in. That makes a total of thirty-five and about enough. The 
frozen spruce peels very good with the drawknife. The bark comes off 
without the sharp edge gouging into the wood. Winter is the time to cut 
and peel logs, I think.
November 26, 1968:
A very beautiful day with the sun lighting the highest peaks at near 
nine o’clock. Today I would get the heavy posts for my cache. Fifteen 
feet long and maybe seven inches through at the butt. Cut and peeled 
and ready to slide in on the ice when it comes.
November 29, 1968: 
Frozen over and about 5/8" thick. Ice as far as I could see up coun-
try. It won’t be long until I will have a safe highway for miles in each 
direction.
No need for the canoe so I towed it up to the point and wrestled it 
into the cabin. A tight squeeze but it is under cover.
I put my new sled to use hauling my cache posts down the lake ice.
March 10, 1969:
My mail read, packages opened and contents stored. Some groceries 
to go to the guest cabin. My cache is a must now.

April 7, 1969:
My roof is nearly clear of snow. The gravel is bare in front of my 
cabin and the ice & snow nearly gone to the lake ice. I shoveled the 
snow clear from around my cabin to protect the logs as much as possible. 
I shoveled out the site for my cache so it will thaw earlier.
May 7, 1969:
I would see about my postholes for my cache. No doubt it was frozen 
solid. Two holes where moss was heavy and I had covered the area with 
more [moss] when clearing for my cabin had no frost. The other two 
some frost. Sand gravel and rocks and not easy digging. I packed some 
water and dumped it in which helped. I would let the frozen ones thaw 
before working them deeper. I cut my heavy poles to length. It will be 
at least nine feet above the ground level. That would be better than five 
feet above winter snow level. I plan to angle the posts in a bit and run the 
Cache after a deep snowfall, March 1990. (Photo by Dick Proenneke, courtesy of the National Park Service)

The Cache
upper ends at least two feet up into the corners of the cache on the inside. 
This would make it solid on the posts without side bracing.
A snow shower moved in and it was a good one. Big flakes and it 
lasted for an hour or more.
In order to have the posts set at an angle and still have the portion 
extending up into the corners of the cache I would have to make a bend 
about two and a half feet from the end. I sawed out a thin wedge. Stuck 
the small end between two trees and put a strain on the long end – clos-
ing the saw cut. I had made some heavy metal plates to straddle the cut 
and hold it closed when I took the tension off. Now have them all bent 
and in traction until I am ready to use them.
May 8, 1969:
Again snow showers and fog blanketed the ice. I would wait and see 
what developed. I deepened the postholes for my cache and did some 
organizing around the place.
May 14, 1969:
Time to saw my cache posts to length and pack more dirt, gravel 
and rock around them. Mosquitoes were busy but no little yellow flies 
that are the worst.
May 17, 1969:
This afternoon I prepared to build my cache – packed the poles to 
the beach near the brushy point. A good level spot and the chips easy to 
clean up. Cut some poles to length. Put down a couple planks for a level 
foundation to build on. Center to center each way 47" and 68". I am 
anxious to see it on top of the posts.
May 18, 1969:
Today would be a warm one and it was getting an early start. I 
would work on my cache today so as to be near if Babe did come. The 
first course of logs notched and nailed to my planks. I cut notches for 
four floor stringers and hewed them to fit. I will add the floor when I 
take it apart for moving and assembly on the top of the nine-foot posts.
Eleven logs in place and the floor stringers in. Pretty good for a start. 
If I work on it tomorrow by evening it will be shaping up pretty good.
May 19, 1969:
Another day to make chips and I made a lot of them. Notches all a 
pretty close fit. Tonight finds thirty in place. A total of 29 inches high. I 
must go at least 36 inches to the square.
May 20, 1969:
A day for more cache building. Forty logs and three feet high to the 
square. An eight-inch rise in the roof and eight inch eaves. The gables 
170 
	
Chapter 3
built up and the ridge log in place. Now for some roof poles which are 
cut to length and waiting to be dressed up a bit. Everything a good snug 
fit. I hope it goes together with no trouble when I climb the ladder with 
all the pieces.
May 21, 1969:
One year ago today I came to Twin Lakes. It was a beautiful day. 
Babe and I sat on the gravel bar at the upper end of the lower lake and 
had quite a visit before he cranked up the little black bird and flew for 
home and I loaded my pack board with the first of two loads that I 
would pack that day. The ice ready to go out and I walked the beach. 
More snow on the beach now than then. The sun bearing down – I 
picked up a sunburn from the sun on the snow. Eight more new lambs 
on the face of Falls Mountain then as there is now. A bull caribou on 
the Cowgill benches. That was the first day of what I believe was the 
most interesting year of my life. What will the next year bring?
Another day to make chips and saw dust. The floor poles to cut to 
length and the roof poles to dress up and put in place.
It started to sprinkle and the wind blew stronger. The spruce boughs 
forming my big OK on the ice took off down country. The lake rising 
and a border of water along the edge. I used my long ladder to get onto 
the ice. Still plenty strong and 28 inches at the test hole of the day 
before yesterday. I doubt that Babe will come till the ice is out unless he 
comes on floats and lands in the open water at the outlet of the connect-
ing stream. I had told him I would hike down if he came but he allowed 
it was a long way.
More rain – not a day for working outside. I needed to rip a pole for 
caps on the eave ends of the roof poles, planks for my door frame. One 
and one-half inch planks for my 20 x 231⁄2 inch door. A stump cut up 
to make the hinges. The woodshed was the place for that – let it rain 
and blow.
Dick’s “caps on the eave ends of the roof poles” refers to a half-round fascia 
for each side of the cache roof.
May 22, 1969:
The hinges done I was ready to take my little log house apart and 
move it up to the cabin and its nine-foot stilts.
My scaffold up and no. 1 log resting on top of the posts. Ten past six 
and time to call it a day. Tomorrow evening should see the cache back 
together and some of the finishing touches done.
May 23, 1969:
Today I would put the cache on stilts. I was anxious to see how 
it would go. A good bearing surface on the posts for the lower logs. 
I mixed up a batch of glue and saw dust to get a real good fit. Two 
 171
The Cache
sixty-penny spikes in each corner. I had salvaged some 1-inch square 
tubing from the Tri-Pacer. I augered a 7/8" hole through each log on the 
four corners and on down into the post. A real tight fit and I drove the 
tubing with the heavy axe. Three quarters of an inch off from square. A 
line from one front corner to the opposite rear corner pulled it square. 
The logs fit perfectly. A 40-penny spike in the heavy ends and 16’s in the 
small ends. Up to the square. The eave logs on, the gables and ridge log. 
The floor stringers and deck poles in as soon as the first four logs were 
in place. The roof poles on and the ends trimmed. The cap put over the 
ends and it was noon. I hardly expected it to go up so quickly. It looked 
good for size and proportion.
Now, the door. The logs forming top and bottom of the door open-
ing were already inletted so all that was necessary was to cut the logs in 
between. My homemade 10-inch plank four and one half feet long made 
Dick building his cache using his 
double-bit axe, Greenlee drawknife, 
the Plumb hatchet, a True Temper 
hammer and “hurdy gurdy” drill. Note 
the ice with water along the edge of 
the lake. (Photos by Dick Proenneke,

more than enough for the 231⁄ 2 x 20 in. door. Some wood to remove 
to get the hinges in position. The door hung and it looked even better. 
Next the roof covering. A course of tarpaper. A sheet of polyethylene 
and moss on top plus the poles to hold it in place.
May 24, 1969:
Today, plug the slots between the roof poles over the eave logs – the 
tar paper and the polyethylene. Trouble with the tarpaper. It had laid 
on the gravel floor under the bunk of the guest cabin so long that it 
stuck together on the lower side and it took a dozen wraps to get a wrap 
that wouldn’t tear. A good calm day for the polyethylene and I had no 
problem there. A search for a good patch of suitable moss. Six loads 
were enough. Poles to hold it in place and a rock on each corner until 
the poles get bedded deep in the moss. Looking better all the time. 
Now a door handle and latch. Some scraps from my hinges would do 
that job.
One can easily look at Dick’s cache and see its grace and beauty. It looks 
like it belongs. By restoring the roof and replacing the legs in 2003, I now 
understand Dick’s intentional selection of the relatively small-diameter poles 
for the cache, and the proportionally larger, near-perfect logs he used for the 
legs. I appreciate the stance of the legs and the scale of the door with its hand-
crafted hinges and latch, and realize none of this happened by accident. This 
was Dick methodically executing what had been his idea, his dream. 
May 25, 1969:
A big stack of hotcakes and I was ready for the new day. I had 
thought of taking the day off but if I worked I could finish my project. 
I was anxious to see it complete so I turned to. The fancy door handle 
and latch to put on. I’m sorta proud of that piece of work. Ready for the 
chinking. A little oakum and a lot of moss. A small cabin and it was 
soon finished. The deck poles dressed up a bit on the lower side for the 
benefit of the ceiling watchers. For all practical purposes it was com-
plete. I took my scaffold down and got my cameras … I went out on the 
ice for a couple shots. Checked the thickness while I was out there and 
found it 18 inches, down 2 from last evening.
Really a warm day with a high of 76° in the shade. A real corn- 
growing day.
Some odd jobs to do – repair my shoes that are too good to throw 
away and not good enough to keep. … My tools to sharpen – saws to 
file. Get cleaned up for this is Sunday.
May 26, 1969:
Now I have a cache but no ladder except my 15-footer that is too 
long and I don’t want to shorten it. I would make an eleven-foot ladder 
of a different style.
174 
	
Chapter 3
Back to my ladder project. I had a real good pole well seasoned. I 
would rip it down the center and with flat sides in, use it for side rails. The 
steps would be short lengths ripped and the flat side up and level when 
in position. A ladder a person could walk up instead of climb. I checked 
down country again. Caribou, the rocks had come to life. Six head and 
one very white, nearly as white as the snow. I would like to see that one 
close up through the pentaprism of the Exakta. Back to my ladder but I 
knew it wouldn’t be finished today. I would visit the white caribou.
With the wind blowing strong I went out to see how my cache was 
taking it. Some movement in the posts but only enough that I could feel it.
May 27, 1969:
Today I would finish my ladder and it was cool on fingers work-
ing bare-handed. Before I finished it started to snow and the wind 
decreased. The longer it snowed the bigger the flakes. Surely it was only 
a shower. Soon the ground was white and no sign of let up. My ladder 
done and a few pictures while it snowed I declared it a letter writing day.
May 28, 1969:
A 12" band of tin around each leg of the cache and 8 inches from 
the top. I would like to see Mr. Squirrel bypass that barrier. A new 
gravel path to the cache, the brush pile to burn on the beach and the 
remainder of my building chips to clean up. A water gauge stake for the 
lake. The level stands at 22 inches above winter low water.
“Mr. Squirrel” learned to easily run past the 12" band of gas-can metal 
wrapped around the cache legs. I even rubbed the metal with paraffin to no 
avail. Every spring I returned to Twin Lakes to find Mr. Squirrel had built 
a winter nest inside. Once the nest was removed, the squirrel abandoned the 
cache for the remainder of the summer. 
May 29, 1969:
Today would be moving day. See if the cache would hold all that I 
could find to put in it but first I would finish my screen and check on 
the livestock. No sheep to be seen but four caribou up country from 
Bonanza Creek. I was anxious to see cows with calves. They are past due 
to arrive. No calves. My screen frame fitted, covered and in place. Now I 
have the mosquito bugs fooled. On warm nights I can open my kitchen 
window and not be annoyed by their singing.
The canoe for hauling my load and it was a good load with all the 
good worthless empty boxes. Then a sorting and transferring job. Large 
near empty boxes and sacks emptied into smaller ones. Winter clothes to 
box up and put in the back corner. A gas can box with shelves for bacon 
grease, syrup, cheese, milk, etc. My sheep skin and horns. Caribou hide. 
The lima beans into a flour sack – and a few worthless but good empty 
boxes. Room to spare, not for a large moose perhaps but for another

good ram, yes. There it was and with the ladder down not even a mouse 
could get in. I only hope I didn’t pack one in.
June 13, 1969:
I hated to leave my happy home and all of my one years gathering. 
Cameras, lenses, gun, glasses and such I would take along. A few things 
to cache here and there. Closed the door and flipped my patent wooden 
lock to the locked position. Babe insisted that I drive and we took off 
down the lake.
June 20, 1969:
Home at last and it was a good feeling to be back where everything 
goes just the way you would want it. No charge for all the grub and 
Babe said he felt as if he owed me more. I was happy with the deal as I 
had helped him only as a favor. He took off for home and I got things 
squared away. The cache really loaded. Everything dragged out of hiding 
and back in place. No one had been here. I was sure of that.
This journal entry speaks to how many people spoke of their relation-
ship with Dick. Dick thought of being flown to Babe Alsworth’s homestead 
to do some work as doing Babe a favor, a way to show appreciation for goods 
and services from Babe’s previous flights to Twin Lakes. Babe was express-
ing appreciation for Dick’s willingness to leave home, and for his exceptional 
skills while working at Babe’s homestead. 
August 3, 1969:
I checked my new slab of bacon for mold and found none. I do believe 
that mold doesn’t form as soon up in the cache as low to the ground.

August 18, 1969:
My meat [from a caribou Jerre Wills shot] stowed away, the hind- 
quarter hung under the floor of the cache, the neck, heart and tongue 
hung from the ridge pole inside. The slab of bacon golden brown. 
August 26, 1969:
A few things from the cache including a lemon sandwich cookie to 
go with my dessert.
September 15, 1969:
My fishing reels to clean and oil – rods to take apart and prepare for 
storage. My cache to reorganize – some one could make a haul there. If 
they do they must furnish their own ladder. Babe said once he doubted 
if many are brave enough to climb that high.
September 24, 1969:
Home and the job started. More washing to do. My cache to reor-
ganize. My fancy gas cans to fill and stack in place. I’ll be leaving light. 
Spotting scope, tripods, fishing rods & reels, some of my lenses including 
the big 400 stays here. Many clothes, socks, boots, pack board – most 
everything in the cache. I hope Babe is right that very few are brave 
enough to climb that high. The ladder will be stored in the thick timber.
September 25, 1969:
I got things squared away pretty fast and the cache was getting 
near full. The covers put over the windows and the stovepipe down and 
inside. Many odds and ends for the birds and they worked like troopers 
packing it away. Little did they know that this was it – no more welfare 
for a long time.

The Cache
Still the ladder to my cache to dispose of and the grizzly egg and my 
round granite ball to ditch in the brush. The door of Spikes cabin to bar. 
Babe says “why not put the ladder in his cabin, out of the weather” and 
so we took it along and laid it along side of the canoe.
Dick found a second “grizzly egg” and the pair is most often seen in photos 
at either front corner of his cabin. The “round granite ball” is most likely the 
rock along the trail from the beach to Spike’s cabin. It is a nearly perfect sphere, 
larger than a basketball.
April 20, 1981: 
I was awake at 4:30 and saw that full moon nearly obscured by 
clouds. By five total cloud cover had taken over. 18° and the calm is what 
caused it. The morning would be slow in warming. To start my working 
day I first took the repaired canoe paddle to Spike’s cabin and picked up 
a dishwashing sponge. Then, I would take my cache ladder and go check 
that nest I had seen two days ago. A tall tree and the ladder got me up 
to good climbing boughs. Broke a few dead branches as I climbed and 
wished it was the camp robber tree for it was a joy to climb. The nest 
was not really a nest but a picnic site for the owls. Not the type of nest 
they would build. It was more of a thick growth of fine stuff but did 
have a depression that would hold eggs. In it were bones of small ani-
mals. Parky squirrels and red squirrel perhaps. Though I doubt that the 
great horned one catches many red squirrels. Some pieces of bones that 
may have been rabbit. Lots of fine hair that looked parky squirrel. So – I 
decided it was a place to put the meat on the table.
Again I took a tour looking for camp robbers. It was calm and if the 
young ones were being fed I could have heard their baby talk for quite 
some distance. I was near Spike’s back 40 when one of my birds came 
by headed for the cabin log timber. Going from tree to tree top and kept 
going. I crossed Hope Creek and climbed the high bank to look over the 
tops of trees below to see a robber on the move. None and I took a turn 
through the heavy timber below the Cowgill benches. Still nothing and 
I came back by my ladder and packed it in.
This morning I would put my winter gear back in the cache. Clear 
that lower bunk in case Will Troyer comes to spend a night as he has 
threatened to do. First a lot of stuff to come out so as to get next winter 
clothes out of sight in the far backside. Doing famously until I started 
down with a sack of flour (25 lbs.) Crack! Something went and I felt 
myself going. I bailed out and landed in the deep snow, the sack of flour 
still under my arm. One step of the ladder was slanted down at a crazy 
angle. Nails through the side rail and into the step was the fastening and 
the wood above the nails had split off letting the step go down. Pretty 
lucky and the deep snow made it a soft landing. Since I built the ladder 
in 1968 I have given a lot of thought as to how a better one should be 
made and still keep it light in weight. I made an emergency repair with 
Dick’s writing on the top of a 5-gallon 
storage can in the cache. (Photo by K.

light line and finished the job at hand. I would think full time now and 
come up with something.
Bail out the woodshed and split a batch is what I did after lunch. 
The day had cleared to partly cloudy and the temperature considerably 
above 40°. This was a melting day.
It came 2:45 and I headed for the lower end. No sheep or bears to 
be seen on the south slopes across. Today even the slush that had frozen 
on top of the ice, early this year, was soft enough to give good footing 
where it was slippery yesterday.
Still no sign of the den being open and that’s good. Going to be 
cubs there if she didn’t die in her sleep. That three-mile trail was a good 
place to think about my ladder repair. Replace the broken step and 
nail it as I had done before then, with my hurdy gurdy drill and 1/8" 
bit drill holes through the front and back edge of the steps near the 
ends (one inch in). Into the side rails 21/2" above the steps drive a nail 
angling down. Using copper coated steel electric fence wire thread down 
through the hole at the rear edge of the step and back up through the 
hole near the front edge – over the nail and repeat the threading proce-
dure a second time. Around the nail again and then with the free end 
wrap the four strands together. Guaranteed to be completely satisfactory.
Dick’s repair of his lightweight cache ladder lasted the remainder of his 
years at Twin Lakes and until 2004 when I replicated it before sending Dick’s 
to the National Park Service archives in Anchorage. 
Dick’s cache ladder and bunk bed ladder are fine examples of his natural 
engineering. By ripping spruce poles into half logs, Dick, in effect, halved 
the weight of both ladders. This also increased the risk of a rung breaking. To

The Cache
avoid falling if a rung broke, Dick described his solution above. He did this 
only to the top rung before thinking of an even safer solution to support the 
remaining rungs. 
Dick threaded a loop of wire through drilled holes in the ladder sides 
and twisted the strands below the rungs before holding the twisted loop in 
tension with a single roofing nail driven through the wire into the bottom of 
the rung. The twisted wire not only holds each rung in tension but also acts as 
an emergency support for a rung that possibly breaks. The wire would safely 
support a climber coming down. The high-tensile steel wire was brittle and 
very difficult to work, especially tying the knot that connects the two ends of 
the wire together. 
It was easy to find the first knot Dick tied on his cache ladder by the 
looseness of the knot. Every knot after that is beautiful and tight. This twisted 
wire is not present on the bottom rung where Dick was not likely to take a fall 
even if the rung broke. It is also not present on the top two rungs where he did 
not step when he was accessing the cache.
Every rung has a double loop of wire wrapped around both ends to make 
the rung less likely to split where the nails are driven into them. Dick gave the 
wrapped wire a refined appearance by running the wire though drilled holes 
on the edge of the rung, just as he had done with the twisted wire rung sup-
ports. Running all of these wires through the drilled holes makes it less likely 
that a loose end of a broken wire would catch the clothing of someone climbing 
the ladder.

Chapter 3
Dick used this same engineering on his bunk bed ladder.
The cache and its spatial relationship to the cabin adds a balanced aes-
thetic to Dick’s wilderness home. I hold an image of Dick and Raymond dis-
cussing the location of a cache in September, 1967, when Dick’s cabin and 
cache were only dreams.
Building the cache in the spring of 1969 ends Dick’s building phase. He 
never built a sauna, a shop or a second room on his cabin. He doesn’t write 
about this in his journals but not continuing to build was clearly a decision 
he made. And for the next three decades living in the wilderness of Twin 
Lakes, he never wavered from that decision. Dick did not want to increase 
his footprint. 
In 2018, Connie Klug sat with K. and me in Spike’s cabin telling sto-
ries of attending several of Dick’s slide shows in Iowa during the 1970s. As 
a young farm wife and mother, she was enthralled with Dick’s stories. She 
remembered clearly his early slide shows were travelogs of his adventures. In 
subsequent years Dick’s shows were more about wilderness, and protecting 
wildlife and wild places. 
Dick allowed Twin Lakes to change him. He arrived a hunter and an 
outdoorsman who wanted to challenge himself in a wild land. He soon became 
part of the fabric of this wild place. He became an advocate for protecting 
wildlife and wilderness and rejected the march of civilization conquering and 
destroying one wild place after another. He did not want the wildlife or wil-
derness around him to suffer because he came.

Five-gallon Gas Cans
“My gas can wash pans in need of repair.  
Next one I make will have wire crimped in the  
top edge to prevent cracking at the corners.  
Square gas cans are a very scarce item these days.”  
– Richard Proenneke

Dick Proenneke lived with his eyes and mind open to how he could make 
those things he needed with what was around him. There was no shortage of 
thin 5-gallon petroleum cans along the shore of Twin Lakes during the early 
years Dick lived there. These cans were sold at petroleum distributors. They 
were sold as two five-gallon cans in a lightweight wooden box with the oil 
company logo on both the box and on each can. By the number of cans left in 
the bush during the 1960s and 1970s, it is safe to say many pilots carried the 
cans only so long as there was fuel in them. These rusting cans have been a 
ubiquitous part of the landscape across the southwest part of Alaska where I 
have traveled since 1965. I commonly found aviation gas 80 or 80/87, but 
also white gas, kerosene, Jet Fuel ‘B’ and aviation gas 100/130.
Dick found empty fuel cans as he “tidied up” around the lake but also had 
kerosene and white gas brought in for his personal use in lamps and stoves. 
Babe Alsworth and others sometimes brought in empty gas cans and larger steel 
barrels for Dick to use. Dick cleaned up hunting camps, hunting cabins, trap-
per’s cabins and any place visitors camped along Upper or Lower Twin Lakes. 
There are several 5-gallon gas cans in the back of Dick’s outhouse, where 
he kept his fuel supply. On one, Dick’s handwriting reads, “Red 80 Octane, 
J-3 Cub Gas” from 1975 or 1976 when he and his brother, Raymond, had 
a Piper J-3 Cub at Twin Lakes. Dick fashioned skillet lids, washbasins, a 
warming oven, hinges, vole-proof storage containers and a long list of other 
items from these 5-gallon gas cans.
The lightweight, 10-gallon wooden boxes that once carried two gas 
cans are historical prizes today judging by the price they commonly sell for 
in antique stores. A stack of these gas-can boxes create ready-made storage 
shelves for both Spike’s and Hope’s cabins as they do in cabins and basements 
across Alaska. Another stack of these wooden boxes with odd bits of metal from 
Dick’s projects is slowly aging along the outside of Dick’s woodshed. Inside his 
woodshed is a stack containing tin cans and jars of every variety of nut, bolt, 
rivet and other commodity Dick might need for a future project. 
May 3, 1967:
I shoveled out the trail to the canoe landing – a long 3 ft. drift 
extending back from the beach. I packed more gravel to resurface the 
trails. Took a piece of gas can and made myself a small bread pan (bak-
ing) for sourdough.
This bread pan, or sourdough roll pan as we prefer to call it, is my favorite 
of all the many dozens of things Dick fabricated from gas cans. Dick baked 
sourdough bread in it almost daily for three decades. It was the first item Dick 
journaled about making from gas-can metal.
I don’t believe he started out to make a pan of an exact size. He started by 
cutting one side out of a 5-gallon can. After cutting the side in half, he folded, 
pinched then hammered the corners to make a watertight pan with no solder, 
no glue and no rivets. Once the corners of the pan were hammered to shape, a

little extra metal was trimmed from the four corners. To complete the pan, the 
top edge was filed or sanded to a friendly touch. 
May 4, 1967: 
This noon I mixed enough sourdough starter (in a small jar) for 
three good-sized biscuits. I mixed it very stiff and added sugar and salt. 
This evening the jar was nearly full. I melted a small amount of bacon 
grease in my new bread pan.  I also worked a small amount of grease 
into the starter after taking it out of the jar and working it in a small 
bowl with a table knife. I divided it in three equal portions and put it 
in the bread pan that I set on the warming shelf behind the stove. I 
prepared the rest of my supper and then put my biscuits in my patent 
oven to bake. In 15 minutes they were done and I was very pleased. They 
looked, tasted and smelled very much like the biscuits I ate with the 
herders in Oregon.
Dick moved most of the handcrafted items he made while living in Spike’s 
cabin to his own cabin in 1968.

June 7, 1967:
I was busy about the cabin and watching the ice. I had been thinking 
of building a good reflector oven from a gas can and in my mind I knew 
just how it should be. The sharp corn knife was just the thing for cutting 
the ends and the little tin snips, pliers and hammer did the rest…
My reflector oven turned out real well and I set it on the rick of 
wood at the side of the stove to warm my rising biscuits for supper.
Dick’s “little tin snips” are indeed small. He had a pair of Blue Bird 7" 
No. 207 and a pair of Wiss 8" No. A-12. The tin snips cut the lightweight 
gas-can metal but do not so easily cut the heavier, round, metal gas cans that 
replaced the thin metal cans in 1977. Dick wrote of using a hacksaw to cut the 
heavier metal of the round cans.

Chapter 4
Dick had three small wooden handle hammers, a Maydox, a True Temper 
and one made by the Philadelphia Tool Co. They are small, lightweight ham-
mers compared to carpenter’s hammers used today.
June 15, 1967:
I put my sourdoughs in my reflector oven and set it in the sun while 
working with the wood. They raised higher than the top of the pan in 
very little more than one hour. Lake trout and biscuits for supper.
June 28, 1967:
The water was smooth as glass. Today might be the day to go for an 
overnight stay at the lower end of the lower lake. I watched the weather 
a bit and decided it was improving. Throw a few things in a gas can 
box and go. A couple spuds, an egg or two, some Quaker oats, bacon, 
flour, butter, corn meal, sugar, salt and pepper. Some detergent and my 
sourdough for today’s biscuits. Axe, reflector oven, frying pan and a few 
eating tools. Also some caribou steak just in case.
July 11, 1967:
I had been thinking of building a cooler cabinet for the shaded end 
of the cabin outside. Something to cool blueberry pies in this Aug. and 
Sept. Cut one side out of a gas can on a line an inch and a half back 
from the side. Roll the edge to make them stiff and smooth. Leave tabs 
to form hinges using wire for hinge pins. Make supports out of wire for 
the shelves. Make a latch and a door handle and that’s about it. It took 
time but the time is not to expensive at Twin Lakes …

of Dick’s cabin. Note the hinge. (Photos

Five-gallon Gas Cans
July 20, 1967: 
A few odd jobs to do. Repair the warmer on the stove [in Spike’s 
cabin]. Make a toilet article compartment for the cabin wall.
August 7, 1967:
While I had a fire I would cook up a batch of blueberry hotcake 
syrup. White sugar, brown sugar and a bit of water and dump them in. 
Wanting to make it something extra I added some maple and vanilla 
flavoring. After I had strained it I added 50% Karo imitation maple 
flavored syrup and a bit of Mrs. Butterworths. 
What I needed was a better mossberry harvester. I made a pan like a 
miniature dustpan and a rake with wire hooks to strip them off and rake 
them in. I tried it on a few behind the cabin and I do believe it will do 
pretty good.
By making his berry rake from the top of a 5-gallon gas can the bail of the 
can becomes the handle of his berry rake. To give the thin metal more stiffness 
and to help hold the rake tines in place, Dick folded a second layer under the 
gas-can top, holding it in place with a folded-over edge and several recycled 
aircraft sheet-metal screws that he cut short and hammered into rivets. 
I identified Dick’s miniature dustpan an hour before departing Twin 
Lakes in 2018. Dick left it in Spike’s cabin where it had been used to clean 
ashes from the wood stove. Dick used his miniature dustpan as a little shovel 
for sand when he was mixing mortar to build his fireplace in addition to its 
original intended use. The miniature dustpan was another of the dozens of 
items I was able to identify after the National Park Service gave me all of 
Dick’s journals on a CD. 
June 29, 1968: 
Now to install the roof jack to take the stovepipe and put some pegs 
in the walls to hang stuff on.
Dick fabricated a roof jack from the side of a 5-gallon gas can to keep a 
space between the sod and the stovepipe.
Dick installed the roof jack when the rafter poles were in place. At about 
that same time he installed a strip of gas can metal over the ends of the rafter 
poles to give support for the tarpaper, Visqueen and sod along the half-log 
fascia. He also used gas can metal as a flashing around his rock fireplace.
July 6, 1968:
I walked over to Marshall Farmer’s to see what all the hammering 
had been about. Empty gallon cans, coarse sandpaper and a brush scat-
tered about as well as the old fiberglass from the boat bottom. I should 
have taken more empty gas cans before as he hauled them all away. I 
have seven and wish I had that many more.

July 7, 1968:
After lunch I went to the cabin to see what I could do with some gas 
cans. I needed a dish pan, wash pan, eating tools pan. These I turned 
out plus a couple other small pans from scraps. Also made a toilet article 
compartment for my bunk. If only I had purloined more gas cans I could 
use a dozen.
Near the cabin nearly the whole day and didn’t think to get my 
biscuits in the pan to rise for supper. I stuck them in my reflector oven 
facing the stove to give them a boost.
Through the years, Dick made many versions of these pans as his original 
ones leaked beyond repair. When he made new ones, he improved the design 
including stronger edge details and how they hung on the wall. There is no 
monotony in looking at Dick’s work. One can see his repairs as the thin metal 
failed and how he made things in ways that would last longer. Dick infre-
quently made or repaired something the same when he repeated a task. His 
work was fluid, reflecting the materials he worked with, his curiosity and his 
open way of thinking. 
Visitors to Dick’s cabin often look at the “toilet article compartments” – 
gas cans with one side cut out that hang on the wall at the end of both his 
upper and lower bunks – and ask what they were. There were toilet article 
compartments at the end of each bunk in both Spike’s and Hope’s cabins, too. 
Dick left a flashlight in each one along with magazines including National 
Geographic, Audubon, TIME, Life and others. 
Knowing Dick liked to stay informed, many people brought him reading 
material including magazines, newspapers and books. There is a story of a

5-gallon gas can roof jack from copper 
to add longevity to the roof restoration.

from Anchorage. Upon arrival the visitor found Dick gone on a hike and so, 
entered Dick’s cabin to leave the newspaper on his desk. The visitor found a 
Sunday paper already laying on Dick’s desk, left by a previous visitor.
July 25, 1968:
I have been wondering what I could do with two gas can boxes. 
Instead of stacking them one on the other. Rip a couple poles and put 
two halves on each side. Space the boxes their width or more. Put doors 
on the front. I ripped a log making five boards on average of 51⁄4" per 
Replicated eating tool pan. (Photo by

board 32 inches long. That took a bit of doing by the time they were 
rough boards then planed on both sides. Then edged and planed on the 
edges. Now I needed hinges so made six of them two inches square. 
Time ran out on me. I will finish that project in the morning.
I am nearly moved in now. Only a few more things to go.
Dick’s gas-can box closet is simple and creative and perfect for its mis-
sion. Dick used two 10-gallon lightweight wooden petroleum boxes and a 
few ripped poles for legs. The hand-sawn, spruce-board doors with a latch and 
gas-can hinges add a special touch to the ambiance of Dick’s cabin. Six-penny 
nails were Dick’s choice for hinge pins.

needed three small straight ones for my gas can box closet.

Five-gallon Gas Cans
I peeled and used the ones I needed for my project and a few 
besides. Completed it looks pretty good and holds lots of clothes and 
small stuff.
July 30, 1968:
Today I was a tin bender. Water bucket, wash pan, dish pan, flour 
pan, storage cans, you name it I made it. The weather thickened and it 
rained a good shower.
Dick cut down the side of each corner of the lower part of the can. By 
overlapping the cut corner Dick was able to push the top part of the can over 
the bottom thus making a storage can. This corner detail evolved when Dick 
made a corrugating (crimping) tool in 1969.
July 31, 1968:	
I made a pan or two and a wash tub and found a way to get the 
paper and stickum off a gas can – boil it in hot soapy water. It is really 
on tight.
August 29, 1968:
A good time to use some of the spray paint Jake [Dick’s brother] had 
sent. Green for the outside of my gas can tin kitchenware. Grey for the 
washtub, reflector oven, tool chest and compartments at the foot of the 
bunks.
December 7, 1968:
I also made a piano type hinge for my grub box. Three months of 
bending was the limit for the hinges formed from strips of tin. Also 
a baking sheet to fit under my oven. I must try some oatmeal cookies 
soon. More meat sawed up and put over the fire and a few steaks from 
the same chunk.
December 8, 1968:
I tried some oatmeal cookies. Not wanting to gamble on a batch of 5 
doz. and all no good – I tried a small batch. They turned out good but a 
bit crumbly. The oven worked fine over my new baking sheet.
Feb. 27, 1969:
While they were bubbling – a good time to work at my tin bending 
job. A round cover with the edge turned down 90°. The only way I could 
see was to corrugate the edge. How to build a machine to do the job. 
A scrap piece of tin bent to form a narrow channel. Three small nails 
in one side and out the other with the two on the outside close enough 
to be caught by the jaws of my large vice grips. Straddle the tin to be 
worked with the ends of the nails. Center nail on one side and the two 
outside nails on the other. Squeeze them with the vice grips and I had

one corrugation. Advance the rig and squeeze again. Eight to the inch 
and it did a real nice job. The cover for my flour pan complete I made a 
smaller one for a stew pan.
This was Dick’s first attempt at making a corrugating (crimping) tool. A 
few months later he thought of an improved tool.
March 4, 1969:
So nice and warm in the sun near my cabin I put the biscuits in the 
pan – slipped them into a plastic bag. Set my reflector warmer on a snow 
bank and the pan in it. Still the sun was high in the sky. 
June 6, 1969:
I wanted to do some tin bending and needed a corrugating tool 
that would do a professional job. With the extra 1" x 1/8" mild steel 
stock Jake sent with the damper assembly I fashioned one. Working on 
the order of a pair of pliers. Two side plates with a single working in 
between. I used it making a round pan and a long pan with round ends 
and it does a very neat job.
Dick’s crimping tool was likely his finest moment in tool making. Dick 
arrived at Twin Lakes with several tin snips but not a crimping tool. He used 
his hacksaw to saw the rough shape of the crimping ends then filed the ends to 
the desired curve.
Several pilots told me the steel Dick used to make his crimping tool is the 
metal connection between the upper end of the strut and the fuselage of either 
a Super Cub or Taylorcraft. Reading Dick’s journal entry above, I know the 
crimping tool was made from mild steel sent to Dick by his brother.
Dick gave his crimping tool to Jerry Mills at Telaquana Lake. A few 
years ago Jerry replicated it and donated his new one for display at Dick’s 
cabin. I have used both Dick’s original tool and Jerry’s replicated tool and can’t 
tell any difference in the crimp or how they look. Jerry replicated it with the 
same spirit that I had when working on Dick’s cabin.
The crimping tool is a remarkable little tool. The owner of a sheet metal 
fabricating business visited the Proenneke cabin a few years ago. I knew he 
was a craftsperson by the way he described working with metal and show-
ing me a copper still he had fabricated for a client. I asked if he would like 
to use Dick’s crimping tool. While crimping a piece of gas-can metal with 
Jerry Mills’s crimping tool he remarked that his professional machine could not 
match the crimp of Dick’s simple tool. 
September 12, 1969:
The sun getting around and bright against the cabin. I set my bis-
cuits in the reflector in the sun next to the wall. Working inside I heard 
tin rattle. That could be only one thing – a squirrel in to the biscuits. I 
ran out and around the corner. Hey you! And out of the reflector and 
Long pans with round ends. Dick used 
these small trays, both rounded and 
rectangular, to store eating and cooking 
utensils. (Photo by Monroe Robinson)

around the corner he went. No damage – he hadn’t broken through the 
plastic bag. Inside and in the big window was just as good and safer.
September 19, 1971: 
First a holder for my stove poker. Clamped to a leg of the stove and 
painted black – it looks as if it came with the stove.
May 23, 1974:
What to do with my miserable floor. Last time I changed the gravel 
and thought the new was the same quality as the old but it wasn’t. Too 
much coarse stuff and I was forever picking up over size rocks and toss-
ing them out. It was getting dirt worked up into it too. No screen or I 
would screen it but that wouldn’t get the dirt out. I thought of weaving a 
screen with electric fence wire. I had a spool of the stuff. Why not make 
one from a gas can. Cut it the long way. Make it about four inches deep 
and punch the bottom full of half-inch holes. I had a square pointed 
steel peg that would do the job. It was no more than 30 min. and I 
had a first rate gravel sifter. I started in at the door and worked back. 
Here you can see Dick’s utensil trays in use. (Photo by Daniel Papke, courtesy of the National Park Service)

Screening the desirable size back on the floor and dumping the over size 
in my mortar packing tub. I was getting the job done and it looked good. 
More than a tub of oversize to dump on the beach. I screened a tub full 
there and covered the thin spots. The dirt I would just wash it back down 
with lots of water. I made a sprinkling can and really wet her down. I 
had hesitated to do this before because it would make the cabin damp for 
a while. Give it a try and I packed and sprinkled four buckets of water. I 
brushed it smooth with my leveling stick and it never looked better.
To make the gravel sifter, Dick punched the square holes in the bottom 
of the halved 5-gallon can with the “square-pointed steel peg” from a broken 
“log dog,” a short length of steel with both ends bent to 90° and sharpened. (A 
new log can be securely held in place for scribing to fit a partially constructed 
wall by driving one end of the log dog in the constructed wall and the other 
into the new log.) After punching the 70 holes, the ragged metal hanging from 
the bottom of the pan was likely rubbed through beach sand to make the torn 
edges smooth. Dick did not leave any of his metalwork with edges that would 
easily cut one’s fingers. We don’t know if Dick used his log dog, which Spike 
likely brought to Twin Lakes, during the construction of his cabin. Dick found 
another use for his gravel sifter and sprinkling can. He made a wire hanger 
for each and hung them above the stoves at his cabin and at Spike’s cabin.
We were told Dick used a handcrafted screen to grade the gravel in his 
cabin to uniform size. I knew about the mitten driers that hung above the 
stoves in the cabins but did not think that he might have used a modified 
5-gallon gas can as his gravel sifter until I read his journals.

June 27, 1974:
This time they got everything in and he [Jim Shake] said all that I 
found of his in the cabin I could have. He thanked me for the good tour 
and told me his latest plan – get a good camera and photograph ducks 
… Off and flying. Once more I was king of Twin Lakes. I had a feel-
ing that Twin Lakes as it was is a thing of the past. People coming and 
thinking gee! This is great. What a wonderful place, not realizing what 
a handicap it puts on a guy who prefers to feel there is no one closer than 
Lake Clark.
I brought a few items down and went back with the canoe. Jim 
had left quite a mess. Part of his last meal still in a stew pan. A sack of 
empty cans, egg shells and paper towels sitting behind the stove. Some 
things he couldn’t take – his wire corn popper, splitting maul, many 
pots and pans, big cans of juice, dry cereal (Wheaties), scouring pow-
der, dishwashing detergent, and canned peaches. Payment enough for 
cleaning up after him.
Jim could never make it alone. When the wood that was in the cabin 
was burned it would be time to go. It would help if he had his grand 
parents to take care of him. He had told me he plans to stay with them 
awhile to keep from going to work near home during the heat of summer.

found in Spike’s  cabin. The inset photo shows a close-up of the 
hanging wire. (Photos by Monroe Robinson)

Chapter 4
I believe that living in the wilderness involved more work than he had 
thought. Twenty-six years old he had said. Not quite old enough to go it 
alone. Anyway I wish him luck where ever he goes and what ever he does. 
July 3, 1974: 
Again my gravel screen came in handy. My woodshed area looks 
neat as a pin because of it.
 Saw and split a good pile of wood. Enough to make the woodshed 
look prosperous. I sure do thank Jim Shake for leaving his 6 lb. splitting 
maul. Just what I need for the tough ones.
Dick seems to imply that he did not have a splitting maul during his first 
few years at Twin Lakes. His larger single-bit axe was likely his splitting tool 
of choice during those years. Later he acquired an 8# splitting maul. 
Dick’s splitting maul, splitting wedge and the gear leg from a Cessna 
180 he found near Lofstedt’s cabin were all used as anvils for various metal- 
smithing projects.
July 4, 1974:
I came down to Glacier Creek and picked up two cases of empty gas 
cans. If I had all my cans full of gas the J-3 wouldn’t get thirsty for months.

Five-gallon Gas Cans
July 25, 1974: 
I had stopped by Farmer’s gas can dump and picked up four. I would 
make Jerre some squirrel proof storage cans for his dry stuff. Sharpen 
the corn knife to cut them into two pieces (three inches from the top). 
Trim the edge of both parts. File the edge of the cover to eliminate the 
sharp edge. Roll the top of the can and hammer it flat. Corrugate the 
corners to reduce the size. A good-looking practical storage can and I 
had four ready to go while it rained a shower and stopped again.
Note the professional looking corners (Page 196) Dick made using his crimp-
ing tool. Dick made dozens of these storage containers to keep food safe from 
rodents. The containers don’t keep the flies out, so items have to be put in sacks. 
Dick left more than a dozen storage cans in his cache each filled and labeled.
August 9, 1974: 
I was rigging up a portable shower bath … With an unopened 
5-gallon can of gas I punctured the bottom with a spike and drained the 
gas into an empty can. Then cut a round hole in the bottom to give the 
bottom its normal strength. In the pouring spout drill many small holes 
in the plastic end that is normally cut out. Screw the cap on to seal it. 
Hang the can bottom up and fill it with warm water. Screw the cap off 
and you are in business.
Here you can see that the plastic seal 
on the spout of the gas can has already 
been removed. (Photo by Monroe

plastic pour spout that was pulled out 
once a thin metal protective cap was 
pried off. Dick drilled multiple holes 
through the top seal of the spout that 
would have been cut off to pour the gas 
out. (Photo by Monroe Robinson)

Chapter 4
January 15, 1975: 
Breakfast over and the storm continued. Much snow blowing on 
the lake and the day blending with the mountain peaks as it was when 
I traveled down yesterday. Today I would spend at home. I put water on 
for a bath and laundry. Reworked my mitten drier hanging in front of 
the stovepipe. I am using my homemade gravel grader (screen) for a dry-
ing rack. I had hung it bottom up by a bridle on each end and now right 
side up so I can just pitch them or any small items (dish washing sponge) 
in to dry during the day or overnight. A real good rig.
September 19, 1975:
Enough light but only enough for filming in front of the cabin. 
We [Dick and Raymond] would show the folks how to make a wash pan 
cheap and easy. Also display some of my other tin ware that was made 
from gas cans. Start with sharpening the old corn knife. Marking out 
the cutting lines, cutting and crimping the exposed edges. And last, 
rolling the handles with a split dowel. That ended roll 209 and leaves 
two rolls to go. 
September 14, 1976:
My floor needed attention and not just the cleaning of dirty spots. 
What Twin Lakes needed was a better mouse trap in the form of wash-
ing floor gravel. I scraped up a tub full and took it to the beach. Got out 
my screening tub, but screening dry is slow work and not really clean 
when I finish. Screening in the lake is mighty frigid. I got me a stirring 
paddle and set the screen on the bottom. Agitated the gravel with the 
paddle. A great success, dirt mixed with the water and light foreign 
material came to the top and drifted away. Batch after batch, tub after 
tub and before the afternoon was done I had a new floor covering. Now 
if I had something to keep the dirt below the gravel. Floor oil or sweep-
ing compound might do it.
September 4, 1977: 
Sunday and a stay at home day. I had beans to cook and caribou 
meat to smoke. Five o’clock reveille for I wanted the meat to get a good 
days worth of smoke. Breakfast over and beans on the fire, I paddled 
up to Hope’s cabin for my little 
handy dandy smoker. I set it up on 
the sand bank behind the holding 
pond. The meat hung from the 
three tripod legs and a plastic cover 
with a small vent at the top slips 
down over the tripod to within a 
foot of the ground. A gas can fire 
box buried in the sand bank face.

Five-gallon Gas Cans
A three-inch aluminum stove pipe and elbow from the firebox back and 
around the bend of the elbow into the bottom of two gas cans standing 
one on the other. Both ends out of the top can and only the top end out 
of the bottom can. A hole in the bottom end to fit over the elbow. 
A few blocks of dead cottonwood sawed and split and I was in busi-
ness. A morning of small chores and tend my fires.
The caribou meat was left up Low Pass Creek by a hunter who had taken 
only the antlers, and some of the choice meat. Dick canoed and hiked to the site 
the following day to salvage the meat, not already eaten by ravens. 
October 7, 1977: 
Plane day coming up Oct. 15, this would be a good day to write 
letters and do small chores. Letters first and so I wrote and watched the 
churning of the green water. Since June 10 I have used nearly and very 
nearly two and one half bottles of ink. Paper nearly 500 81⁄2 x 11" sheets 
in the last two seasons at Twin Lakes. Envelopes, packages of them. I 
wrote till noon took a break. The snow had stopped but visibility was 
very limited and I didn’t look for sheep or moose.
No more square 5-gallon gas cans and all pilots are unhappy about 
it. No more good cans and no more good gas can boxes, they say! The 
new round ones heavier and won’t stack as close in an airplane. Not tin 
plated, they rust out in no time. A good-looking heavy round can with 
a good strong fold flat handle on top. What would they be good for? 
Today I would make a storage can from one. A real wolverine, mouse 
proof, damp proof storage can. With all the gas shook out I let it dry and 
then with my little hack saw, sawed three inches off (down from the top). 
With my 12" flat file I smoothe the two top edges and with my patented 
corrugating tool I corrugated the top of the bottom section. Reduced it 
in size enough so the top would slip down over it. A real neat looking job 
and strong like you wouldn’t believe. One filled with silver dimes would 
be worth quite a bit… My mind satisfied on the usefulness of the new gas 
cans I went back to the drawing board to write more letters.
Selling petroleum in these heavier cans was an unwelcome change for 
many users. Dick made several things from these round cans. Judging by the 
dozens of handcrafted items he left at his cabin made from the lightweight cans 
and their boxes, it is clear he preferred the lighter square cans. Dick stockpiled 
these square cans and left a supply of them when he departed Twin Lakes. The 
thin rectangular cans have a coating of tin that give them a small amount of 
protection against rust. The round cans are not coated and more easily rust but 
the thickness of the metal gives them some life before rusting through.
During the years of the rectangular cans, many cans had a second life as 
shingles. With the top and bottom of the can sliced off, the sides were opened 
into a flat sheet with a tin surface. Many cabins and caches were roofed with 
gas-can shingles. They shingled the walls of more than one outhouse.

Chapter 4
Billy Trefon Jr., a Native Alaskan from Nondalton, told me when he was 
young all of his friends became expert at picking the side panels of wooden 
gas boxes with straight grain. From these panels they fashioned arrows for 
hunting.
November 7, 1977: 
I wanted to make another storage can from a new heavy round one. 
This one I would cut in half so I could have a combination of heights. A 
long top section and a long bottom to make a super tall can or short top 
and short bottom for a stubby.
December 9, 1977: 
I really got off to a bad start. Opened the door to see how cold it was 
and about a double hand full of frost fell down from the logs above the 
door and right down the back of my neck.
A few chunks to finish sawing and to split and then a chore I had 
been planning. Cut that can of honey if it was settled low enough. It was 
and I took it outside and used the corn knife. 21⁄4" down from the top, 
I cut it off. Just right, and I had to dig out around the edge to use my 
corrugating tool on the corners. I dug out a jar of good sugared honey 
and put the cover on. Perfect, now the refilling of my containers is just a 
matter of yanking the cover off and spooning it out.
Last evening I had to dig out another bottle of ink. 31⁄2 bottles I 
had used since June 10. How many miles of continuous inked line? I 
wish I knew.

June 30, 1978: 
Now, time is getting short for the V.I.P. party if they are on sched-
ule and visiting Twin Lakes. I had cleaned my floor gravel not long ago 
but I would do it again. This time after washing it I would screen it with 
my mitten drier over the stove. A cut lengthwise gas can with a pattern 
of half-inch holes. Scrape up the fine screen tub full, take it out and 
wash it. Bring it in, dump it into the coarse screening tub and screen it 
back in place. Many trips to the lake and near 1pm before I finished.
Here Dick is using both the fine screen he left at Spike’s cabin and the one 
with 1/2"-square holes from above his stove. Dick described this same process 
to K., referring to it as “spring cleaning.”
December 6, 1978:
My five gallon honey can empty was due to become a good storage 
can. The top edge of the can crimped to lose the sharp edge and then the 
corners corrugated so the top would over lap. Dave [Johnson] the warden 
had asked me how I made those from the new round cans. He had a 
batch of them and his wife wanted some storage can. I offered him the 
use of my corrugation tool and he might borrow it when he got ready. He 
could do most any thing he said but how did I cut the fool things. Draw 
a line around and chase it with a hack saw. While I was in the business I 
made a round one and when he comes I will ask him if his wife ever got 
her storage cans made. If not, I will send him home with a couple if he 
will take them. Game wardens don’t like to be put on the spot for such as 
that. Not easy to write up a violation after the guy has done you a favor.
December 8, 1978:
Biscuit sponge rising and when I put the molded dough in the pan I 
decided that ten years and a half is old enough for a home made gas tin 
biscuit baking pan. Carboned heavy on the outside and both ends not 
the same for shape. I would open the tin bending shop and make a new 
one. Those folded corners take a bit of doing to get them looking factory 
perfect. There had to be a better way and after the pan was done I took 
a piece of card board and figured out a fool proof system to get the four 
sides and corners identical in shape or very nearly so. A corner would be 
done like so 
Now and soon I 
must make another 
one and file the sys-
tem in the back left 
corner of my head.
December 9, 1978:
I wrote a letter and puttered about the cabin. Tried my new dreamed 
up system of building the biscuit pan. It didn’t turn out to be as simple, 
202 
	
Chapter 4
easy and smooth as I expected and partly because it was dark and I got a 
bend line off a bit. Next one will come easy. A big filing job followed the 
tin bending. My anvil, a chunk of iron out of Spike’s little square stove, 
and I use it often when I need metal to back up the metal I’m pounding 
into shape. 11" x 21⁄2" x 1⁄4" its dimensions and well parted with arc 
weld metal along the edges. A heap of filing but I had nearly half of it 
smooth by lunchtime.
Dick folded the corners of his new bread pan more accurately than his 
original pan. These little folded metal pans are fun to make, and sometimes 
they look as professional as you had hoped.
April 24, 1979: 
Now I got a rude shock. I had mixed batter for hotcakes and set it 
on the stove shelf to rise. The starter in the mitten drier above. Both 
looked very flat and how could that be. I tried to remember putting in 
some thing that is forbidden.
October 10, 1979: 
I needed a new wash pan so brought back a new gas can from the 
early sixties. On cutting into it I found rust and one side with many 
holes so I made a dust pan of the other three sides. A real nice dust pan 
to use on my new carpet. I still needed a wash pan so got a can from 
behind the woodshed. Bright as a new dime and it made a nice one. I 
find that a pan is good for about four or five years before the tin plating 
is gone. 
Dick used outdoor style carpet over his gravel floor from this time on. He 
asked the National Park Service to remove it when he left to live with his 
brother in 1999.
Here I show part of the process of 
making Dick’s bread pans. The sides 
are folded …  
the corners are pinched … 
then the corners are pinched tighter and 
folded some more. (Photos by Monroe

Five-gallon Gas Cans
April 25, 1981: 
Glen began to hand out the cargo.
From Helen White 10 tablets (yellow), two bottles of blue black and 
100 envelopes. From Jake a package of assorted items and among them 
a “Tater baker” stove top oven. One he has had for years and didn’t use 
… A package of dried apples and banana chips from Whitey Mohr of 
Seattle. Hip boots and trail food from that good fisherman Gail Taylor 
of Bettendorf, Iowa. All these things had to wait while we visited and 
got my outgoing ready. 
May 1, 1981: 
Bread rising and I would test Jake’s “Tater Baker” oven. A 
good-looking rig but looks and results are not one and the same. The fire 
lively I popped a bowl of corn too. Strange that some company doesn’t 
come out with popcorn cereal. With milk and sugar it is as tasty as 
most. Perhaps my bread pan wasn’t centered perfectly under the dome 
shaped lid for one side of the top was plenty dark and the other light. 
The bottom very light in color when I turned the loaf out in a foil pan. 
Do believe my old stand by will do better with less heat. I’ll try it again.
May 31, 1981: 
Today I would stay close and write a batch. With all the open water 
a floatplane could drop in any time but I wouldn’t expect one for another 
week or two.
It was early when I started writing. A breeze came down the lake 
and it increased to a blowing down wind. The ice began to back out and 
it must have been very thin for by evening it would be 80 acres of water 
and no sign that the main mass of ice had moved down.
My porcupine was still cooking on the installment plan and would 
be done by noon so I had a sample fried in bacon grease. Very good and 
I wouldn’t ask for better wilderness meat.
I wrote steady until 3:30. 
Bread was rising and ready for the oven and this time I would use 
the “tater baker” again. I would take the elevated plate out to get more 
brown on the bottom and less on top. The top has a covered vent that 
can be opened too and that I opened halfway. It did a real nice job of 
baking and quicker than my old gas can oven. A baking fire is a corn 
popping fire so I popped the big mixing bowl full. After the corn and 
just as an experiment I sprinkled a little whole kernel wheat in the skil-
let along with a little oil. In no time it was parched and chewed easily. 
After supper I would parch some for my mornings porridge. Wheat 
softened by roasting might be a good cereal along with raisins and rice if 
my rolled oat groats supply fizzles out.
July 10, 1981:
I would make Will Troyer a good storage can. Before he left he had

Chapter 4
dumped in a can of gas and asked me if I had use for the empty can. 
One of the new round heavy ones and they make the best storage cans 
but I have enough and a few to spare. In the woodshed and equipped 
with my tools I went to work. Sawed it in two pieces 3 inches down 
from the top and filed the edges smooth and with my little handy dandy 
corrugater I wrinkled the top edge of the bottom piece. Reduced the 
diameter enough to slip the top over and then stamped her down good 
and tight to stretch the top and reduce the bottom a bit. Stopped down 
tight I think you could toss it in the lake and it would float for a long 
time. Sounds quick and easy but it is heavy metal and take some horse-
power to complete one. To remove the cover when the can is loaded 
– lift on the handle and hit the side with the heel of your hand and it 
pops off every time. The job done and I hope he makes use of it in his 
$6,000.00 cabin.
I had another project in mind. Fix that can of honey in Hope’s cabin 
so I could spade the honey out and not fish it up through that screw cap 
hole. Too full to cut the top off two-inches down. I had top cover, for 
a square can, to spare – so I would cut the top out and reduce the edge 
enough to get the cover on. A bit of a struggle for I had that crimped 
edge to contend with. ‘Can do’ was the W.W. 11 Sea Bees slogan so I 
acted like a Sea Bee. Brought back a jar of honey with me.
November 6, 1981: 
I did some carving on my latest creation in birch and it was com-
fortable in the woodshed. After some reorganizing in the cache the 
bread was ready for the “tater baker” oven. A beautiful little loaf and I 
hated to cut it come suppertime.
November 21, 1981: 
A big halo told me the location of the sun behind the mountains…  
I had bread ready to go into the “tater baker” oven and I wanted to round 
out my woodpile and put the water hole plug in before calling it a day. 
Pop a bowl of popcorn while the stove was hot too. The lake ice I found to 
be 6 inches thick. One and one half inches per 24 hours since freeze up.
November 27, 1981: 
Getting dark and snowing again as I put the bread in the tater baker 
oven.
December 20, 1981: 
I was in need of something to set my water bucket in. It comes in 
from the water hole wet and snow stuck to the bottom and the cold 
water causes it to sweat severely. I could make a round pan from gas 
can tin. So – with the corn knife I cut the ends out of a beat up gas can. 
Split it down the side and laid it out flat. The pan would be 101⁄4 inches 
 205
Five-gallon Gas Cans
in diameter with a 11⁄ 8 inch corrugated, slightly flared rim. The sharp 
edge turned back 1⁄ 8 in. and hammered flat before turning up the rim.
August 22, 1982:
This morning we would pick some mossberries to go out when 
Paul [Haertel] came this afternoon for Hank [Haertel, Paul’s son]. So we 
scooped a couple gallons. Hank used a picker and I my dustpan and a 
little many-fingered rake I had made years back. Just rake them in to the 
dustpan. It was fast but collected more garbage than a picker.
February 22, 1983: 
I needed a new pan of the square type from the old style square gas 
cans. The old one showing lots of use after maybe three years of steady 
use. So – I opened the tin bending shop and turned out a real nice one. 
Neat narrow crimped edges and a very smooth roll job on all four sides. 
Gas cans, I have enough for the duration and then some.
February 23, 1983: 
To start my working day I would paint the outside of my new wash 
pan. Red oxide primer is good for that. Painted my stovetop oven too for 
it stands heat well.
February 25, 1983: 
Then I thought of a project I have been thinking of. Replace the 
gas can tin ware of my old mortar-mixing tub. I used it when I built my 
fireplace 14 years ago. A simple frame of small spruce sapling material 
to support a gas can tub. I often use it to pack gravel to touch up my 
pathways and this winter I have used it for chips from the wood making. 
Better do it, and I canceled my trip. This tub I would make full gas can 
size. Lay it on its side and slice across the top surface next to the ends. 
Split it length wise down the center and roll the halves to the edge. Just 
happened to have four long 1/8" brass stove bolts that would go through 
handles, frame and tub. The rolls along each side made it very rigid. 
Only the four bolts through the tin so treated with epoxy to seal the bolt 
heads to tin it makes an ideal wash tub.
Dick found a second use for the mortar-mixing tub he made on September 
9, 1968, as a wash tub. In the journal entry above it had rusted beyond repair 
and he was replacing it.
May 23, 1984:
This morning I would paint red. Small wash pans, gas can oven, 
mitten drier over the stove and more.
December 4, 1984: 
So balmy out that I decided to go to Hope’s cabin and work on that

can of honey. Cut the top 21⁄2" off and fashion a telescoping cover from 
it. So I took my tools and trudged the timber trail. I moved the can out-
side the door to have good light. Used the corn knife to make the cut. 
I was a little surprised to learn I was cutting below the surface of the 
honey at least halfway around. Well sugared and no problem except that 
the cover was well loaded. A few empties from a box containing pea-
nut butter jars took care of the problem. With snips I trimmed the top 
edge of the lower portion and corrugated it so the cover would telescope 
over the edge. The cover had to come to my cabin to be cleaned up and 
the edge trimmed. So now, yank the cover off and there is the sweets, 
gallons of it.
April 14, 1985:
When the mission girls were here Doris [Hagedorn] spied my gas can 
wash pans. “Ours finally gave out”, she said. I had given them one about 
15 years ago. They had used it a lot she said. I have a batch of square 
cans still and not many do. This afternoon I would make them a couple 
new ones and a dustpan too. So, I opened the tin bending shop on my 
carpet and filled the order. One can was like new and should last a long 
time. A spot of rust on the bottom will soon become a pinhole.
March 15, 1989: 
I heard a little airplane. Yellow and black trim – that would be 
Daniel Clum again. Last time March 5th I had told him I could use 
more eggs some time.
We met out on the ice and he said, “judging from all the tracks you 
have had lots of company.” Here alone I have a path way where ever I go 
but civilized people scatter and make tracks as if a bunch of caribou had 
been here.
He came in and we visited an hour or more. He didn’t have any 
thing to do so thought he would come in. I wanted to pay him but he 
said no. He is burning car gas that is cheap. Well, I would write him 
a check for car gas that he said was about ninety cents per gal. “How 
much does your little bird hold?” I asked him. “Oh about 25 gallon?” So 
I wrote him a check for $30.00. I would like to make a deal with him to 
do my flying. He seems dependable.
March 16, 1989: 
This morning I had a project in mind that I have been thinking 
about for weeks. What is the easy way to break into a 5-gallon can of 
sugared honey. I could heat it for a day or two but I like my honey real 
thick. Square can with 21⁄2" hole and screw cap. Twisting it out with 
my big bacon slicer is a slow process and nearly impossible in below 
zero weather. As the native says about making duck soup – “first, get 
the duck”. In my case it was “get the can of honey”, so I went to Hope’s 
cabin with my G.I. pumpkin seed sled. I had thought of just cutting the 
 207
Five-gallon Gas Cans
top out but that makes it not easy to re-seal plus the can when empty is 
not the best for a storage can.
Here in front of the cabin at zero degrees I laid it on its side and 
penciled a line around it three inches from the top. Then with my good 
big Iowa corn knife I cut on the line around the 4 sides. No honey leak-
ing out and it was full to the cap. Pulling hard I failed to separate the 
top 3 inches from the bottom. So I pushed the corn knife down through 
full width of the can. Now I had 3 inches of honey in the lid and the can 
full to the top. I had an empty can to put it in so dug the honey out of 
the cover and also lowered the honey in the can 21⁄ 2 inches. Trimmed 
the two cut edges (can and cover) with tin snips. Put the cover on the 
stove topside down to melt the honey remaining in the cover. With my 
handy dandy corrugating tool I went around the lip of the can so the 
cover would slip over. Now I had two storage cans with tight fitting slip 
on covers. It took awhile but a perfect job of breaking into that new can. 
How long will 60 lbs of honey last? About a year perhaps.
May 30, 1989: 
This evening I filleted my lake trout – cut the fillets in half and 
wrapped them in foil, after seasoning them. Baked them on top of the 
stove under my oven cover.
August 5, 1989: 
Some bare spots showing on my walkways and lots of good fine gravel 
being thrown up by the surf. I would screen a batch to dress it up. My 
screen is the mitten drier over the stove. I load it and then shake it over the 
thin spots. The coarse stuff I take back to the beach. It looked better and 
I was ready for more touristas. That long time Park superintendent Larry 
Collins thought this a beautiful spot compared to theirs in Calif.
December 21, 1990: 
No Leon and I decided to do something about my floor before 
cold comes again. I took sled and No. 2 shovel up to Carrithers point. 
There I found a coarse sand spit exposed and dry enough that it wasn’t 
frozen except for minor spots that would break up in shoveling. I saw 
the grouse had been there too. Just about as much as I could pile on is 
what I came down the shoreline with. More than I would need or so I 
thought. It only took a few minutes to move everything and expose as 
much floor as yesterday. With my mitten drier gravel grader for dressing 
my pathways I used to screen out the coarse few. Load it on the sled, 
bring it in and shake it vigorously. Throw the coarse on the snow-cov-
ered beach. I screened the full load on the area needing a lift and then 
spread it with a slat. Blended it in with the edge of the remaining carpet 
pad and a bit higher away from it. Looked good and I put the carpet 
back in place. Just got done in time for the light was going fast. It looks 
good and walks good – glad I did it.

August 1, 1991: 
My gas can wash pans in need of repair. Next one I make will have 
wire crimped in the top edge to prevent cracking at the corners. Square 
gas cans are a very scarce item these days.
August 7, 1992:
My radio refused to transmit and was it important that it should. 
My best days have been without such.
Getting into after noon when I heard the whine of Glens 206. It was 
pretty lumpy on the lake and it landed above the point and came down 
along the beach. A strange, completely strange, pilot was out quickly to 
handle it in the surf. A big man and introduced himself as Steve from 
North Carolina. Esther [Caporelli] was soon on the beach one more time 
and said she was glad to be back. She had invited the pilot in to inspect 
the cabin. Again a big wheel barrow load of groceries and I wonder how 
much the bill was. I failed to see how we could consume it all without 
spoilage. And she said I got you a new set of dishes, cups and bowls. I 
remembered yours were getting a little tired. That sorta rubbed me the 
wrong way. Me and my dishes had toughed it out for 24 years and sur-
vived many winters together. The plate larger and didn’t fit in my wash 
pans. Too big to fit in my oven cover which holds my hotcake batter over 
night. For my part they could go in storage in Hope’s cabin. She brought 
string beans from her garden and a batch of corn on the cob. It is best if 
you cook it all at once and then store it for future use she said. I had a pot 
of beans cooking. Soon the stove was smothered and she was out birding 
on the creek flat. So it was a time to think of the good “ol days”.
Dick’s radio was a hand-held two-way radio to communicate with the 
National Park headquarters in Port Alsworth.
His use of 5-gallon gas cans was almost 
endless. Dick made lids for many pans and 
skillets, including one for a Griswold 
skillet. Each one is unique. I think Dick 
greatly enjoyed the creativity of mak-
ing the things he needed. For the bails 
of most lids, including the one for a 
Griswold skillet lid, he used half of 
the bail of a 5-gallon gas can. The 
gas-can bail was cut in two then 
each half was re-bent to make 
a bail. The bail was held in 
place with a small piece of 
gas-can metal folded over 
the ends of the bail, pushed through a slot 
in the center of the lid, then folded flat against the 
inside surface of the lid.

June 27, 1967: 
What to do today – fog hung low along the mountains I had been 
wanting to build a short bench using a near half section of log. I knew 
where there was just the log section to do it – up the Farmer’s property 
line and past the corner where Fred Cowgill had sawed his boards. I 
took my pack board and axe and paddled down. It was a heavy chunk 
and I had a bit of trouble getting on my feet after getting into the 
shoulder straps of the pack board lashed to the chunk. The surveyors 
had cut a few small spruce when they brushed out his property lines. 
These would be just right for legs. I had a good load coming back to 
the point. I couldn’t split the chunk – too many knots so I would cut it 
down with axe and adz. I had the adz good and sharp and the chips did 
fly. It looked as if someone had built a cabin. The chips are the best of 
kindling. I cut it down better than half – dished it a bit, peeled the bark, 
sawed the ends square. Augured holes for legs. No bit large enough so I 
used the 5-inch chisel to enlarge the holes. I sawed and peeled the legs – 
trimmed them to fit, split the ends and made wedges to tighten them in 
the holes. Drove the legs in the holes with the adz head. Cut them down 
to one foot six over all height and she was the finished product. One foot 
eight and a half-inches long, thirteen-inches wide.
June 29, 1967: 
I would spend the afternoon building a backrest for my short bench. 
The end I had cut off was already shaped on the front. I slabbed off the 
back side and worked it down with the axe, auger some holes and make 
some pegs to mount it with. By evening it was ready to put on. Weather 
had turned sour down country and getting that way here.
June 30, 1967: 
By adding a backrest my short bench became a chair – quite com-
fortable and very rustic.
With only an axe, saw, chisel, wood auger, adz, pocketknife & rule 
a man could furnish a cabin and not be ashamed of his furniture. The 
chair completed and the weather fairing up a bit I would give Hope 
Creek a try.

Chapter 5
What started out to be a “short bench” turned into a comfortable chair. 
Dick placed it at the base of a spruce tree on the beach near his cabin. It was a 
favorite spot for Dick to sit reading, writing or taking in the ever-changing 
grandeur of “One Man’s Wilderness.” 
After looking at Dick’s cabin, visitors frequently gravitate to his beach 
chair where they are immersed in the raw beauty of Twin Lakes. Visitors have 
told us that their image of “wilderness” will forever be their time at Dick’s 
cabin and Twin Lakes.
K. frequently took visitors on a short walk beyond Dick’s woodshed. 
Within a few yards, Dick’s cabin, cache and woodshed are no longer visible. 
Visitors can no longer see the floatplane that flew them to Twin Lakes. They 
can no longer see any overhead power lines, roads or trails. They can only hear 
the sounds of wilderness. Often visitors would say something like, “Oh, now I 
can see why Dick moved here.” It is a moment they will remember for as long 
as they remember Dick’s cabin.

August 2, 1968:
I need a stool out side to sit things on when opening the door and 
such. I have a twelve-inch log from the tree I removed to build the 
cabin. I would saw off a 10-inch length and put the legs on the end. 
Give them a flare so it wouldn’t tip over if you stepped up onto it.
A thin cut to even it up. The cut looked so nice why not make more 
thin cuts and plane them smooth and use them for placemats and hot 
pads to set hot pans on. It would save my plastic tablecloth.
These placemats were “badly soiled by freeloaders” sometime during the 
winter of 1969-1970. There are photographs of the placemats Dick made to 
replace the badly soiled ones later in this chapter.
 August 10, 1968: 
Today among other things I would build my butchers block for 
outside the door. A 10" length of 11-inch log with three legs. It was 
finished in short order.
The “butcher block” is the “stool” Dick started to build on August 2. The 
butcher block only resided in front of Dick’s cabin for a short time, until he 
constructed a pair of spruce burl tables that remain there today. Dick moved 
the butcher block into the corner of his cabin where it became the stand for his 
galvanized water bucket and drinking cup.

Chapter 5
How about making a diagonal cut on the same log and slice off a 
5/8" slab or two. I sawed one and it was very even so I planed it that 
brought the grain and growth rings into view. I cut another not quite as 
true but real close so I planed it too. They will make nice decorations for 
wall or mantle. I gave the backside of them a coat of clear shellac and 
bees wax on the smooth side to keep them from checking. If it will I’m 
not sure. 
I needed more movies of my latest improvements so hauled out the 
camera gear and hope to have some interesting shots.
This diagonal cut sat on Dick’s fireplace mantle for some time. He later 
used it as a plaque for a beautiful spoon to hang on the wall with the words, 
“Twin Lakes Champion – Sourdough Biscuits and Beans.” 
March 4, 1969: 
Time enough to sand Hope’s wooden spoon. A chunk of wood for a 
seat in the warm sun I sanded it to perfection. I do believe this was the 
most pleasant day of 1969.
The tree stump Dick removed from his cabin site became the wood he used 
to make his butcher block, placemats and plaque for his sourdough spoon. The 
seat Dick “sanded to perfection” sits on one of the stump’s roots where it makes 
a comfortable place to sit with your back against a tree. From there you can see 
the front of Dick’s cabin.

August 5, 1968:
Cut three poles at Lofstedt’s. Two to make a long ladder for my 
meat tree.
August 15, 1968:
I would build my ladder – a fifteen-footer for my meat tree. The side 
poles all cut peeled and waiting. I had lots of short ends for rounds.
August 16, 1968: 
I tried my new ladder. Just the right length for 
the meat tree. I took down the chunk of salted cari-
bou hide that I had wrapped in plastic and hung up 
last fall. What would be its condition – I was very 
surprised. Instead of being dry and stiff it was as 
soft and pliable as buckskin. Say – that would make 
some thing warm for winter.
For the sides of his meat tree ladder Dick found 
two small trees with very little taper, making it light-
weight for its length. In addition to using it to access 
his stored meat under a tarp in a high crotch of a spruce 
tree, Dick used this ladder in the construction of his 
cache and as a filming platform to access birds’ nests. 
This caribou hide is likely what Dick used to make 
cushions for his desk chair and small three-legged stool.
April 16, 1979: 
This afternoon I would pack a sturdy pole 
down and rig my ladder for another look into the 
owl’s nest. Ten feet of film in the Bolex that I 
wanted to expose before plane day. A few hun-
dred yards down and the sun beat down on the 
snow. Then I realized I didn’t have my Winchester 
shooting glasses along. I figured there would 
be little sun so didn’t come for them but later I 
wished that I had. Should have done as Babe said 
he has done – pulled his old grey stocking cap 
down over his face and looked through the coarse 
knit.
I found the mother one on the nest when I 
walked up the flat. It seems that she sits higher 
now and I expect she does with two chicks and 
a big rabbit in the nest. I lashed the pole up the 
center of the ladder extending it three feet above 
the top.

December 21, 1968: 
Sawing the meat on the butcher block outside I made a batch of 
crumbs for the jays and chickadees. The magpies up to their usual 
greediness stole all they could. I would catch one and rough him up a bit 
and see if he came back. It had been a long time since I saw a figure four 
trap but I cut one out and used a large square cardboard box for the trap. 
I tied a meat scrap to the trigger and waited. Here came the squirrel 
who sat up and gave it the eye – ate some crumbs and started to leave 
only to remember the strange new gadget. Back he came and gingerly 
looked it over and disappeared under the tilted box. The figure trembled 
a bit and collapsed – down came the box. A bit of rattling around inside 
and out he came (got his nose under the edge) headed for a tree. Soon 
he was back trying to get under the box again and pushed it aside to 
clear the bait. I moved in and saved the day.
December 24, 1968: 
Another good looking day coming up. Winter is better than sum-
mer I do believe. The day before Christmas. A day to get things ship 
shape – level the floor, dust the wall logs. I put my washtub over the fire 
and put out a good laundry. Being close by I would try to trap a magpie 
with my box trap. I set it on the lake near the moose head. A huge paper 
sack under the box so as to have a cover when I turned it over. I set it 
and watched. One magpie only took an interest in it and the bait scat-
tered around inside. He couldn’t resist it but couldn’t bring himself to go 
under. With much hopping around this way and that – getting close and 
jumping away only to come right back. Finally I noticed it was tripped 
so I went out. No bird so I set it again and watched. He came back and 
I soon learned why it tripped. He took a corner of the paper sack in his 
beak and tugged hard. It didn’t move but after several tries it moved and 
down came the box. I set it again taking the sack from under. Now I had 
him fouled but he wouldn’t go under the up tilted box. Who arrived on 
the scene but the squirrel. I had never seen him on the lake before. He 
looked the situation over all four sides and from on top and then calmly 
went under and down came the box. I had placed a rock to top for weight 
but the little atlas moved the box anyway. Out he came from under and 
ran for the timber. Soon he was back – dug a hole along side – went 
under and in a very short time came out and was gone. Later I found all 
the bait gone. The chewed string that held the bait still at the trigger. 
Who would be considered the winner the magpie or the squirrel?
I didn’t know what to make of the three spruce sticks Dick left between the 
rafter poles in his cabin, tied together with a few feet of small cord. As made, 
these sticks do not make a traditional figure-four trap but even without read-
ing Dick’s journals they certainly reminded me of such a trap.
It’s been more than 50 years since I made one of these traps but in my 
youth I used them more than I wish to remember as I am now aware of the 
Figure-four Trap

trauma I put too many small animals through. The weight of the raised lip of 
a box keeps a traditional figure-four trap set until the bait attached to the end 
of the figure-four is touched.
Fred Hirschmann, a seasonal ranger who knew Dick in the 1980s, once 
sat with me on Dick’s beach and tried to figure out how Dick used his figure- 
four trap. I tried Fred’s idea and assume this is how Dick used his trap.
February 10, 1969:
My camp robbers have started something. I heard one alight on the 
spruce buck horns (forked roots of a spruce stump nailed on the end 
of the ridge log). I looked out and there were two sitting in the nearby 
spruce as much as to say, what’s for breakfast? I tossed them out some 
scraps and went on with my breakfast. Again the same sound and again 
the birds waiting. This happened three or four times in a half hour. I 
always have time to feed my birds when they come begging.

August 8, 1968:
Better I should write some letters first thing. Not good to have the 
plane-drop in unexpected and no out going mail. I got busy and had six 
letters and two small packages ready by noon.
Now for my bench project. I had some slabs for a top, pole ripped 
down the middle for cleats and small poles for legs. I started and it just 
grew and ended up being more of a small table and a rather nice looking 
one at that. 15" x 32" top and 28" high. That out of the way I started the 
clean up. Move all scraps to the woodshed or under the trees nearby. 
Some I could use so I kept them separate. I came onto a 4" dia. log end 
that wasn’t split so augered a 11⁄ 2" hole three inches deep in one end and 
planed it smooth. Then cut it to 33⁄4" length. A real nice rustic holder 
for pens and pencils. Still time, I cut some brush under my clothesline 
and some willows that needed to go. Looks much better now.
The day is done and it was a good day 
like all days at Twin Lakes.
March 17, 1969: 
A tour back through the woods before sun set. I 
found a huge burl on a small dead tree. I am tempted to 
saw it off and see what I can make of it.

March 19, 1969:
A good day to go back and salvage the big spruce burl. A good sized 
one – it measured 30" x 27" and about fourteen inches thick. I couldn’t 
think of anything that I could make from it in its whole form so I would 
slab it. A 4" cut next to the tree – then a 3" cut. The cap would be about 
7". A lot of sawing in cuts that wide and deep. The wind was picking 
up – snow began to move in the timber. By 1:30 I was finished with the 
saw. Two slabs on the pack board and in for lunch. Another cut and the 
tools to bring in and by now it was really howling. I don’t remember 
when I have seen it blow harder.
April 8, 1969:
I went back and finished working up my burl spruce. I cut six slabs 
from it plus a couple small burls. A few nice table tops if sanded and 
varnished.
May 31, 1969:
Today I would see what I could do with the thick slab of spruce 
burl. 31⁄2" thick 28" the long way and 261⁄2" across. A search for suit-
able legs. The inch and a half auger to make the holes. Planed smooth on 
both sides. The legs drove in and some small rounds for spacers between. 
A real sturdy and good looking table. So nice I gave it a coat of varnish.
July 30, 1969:
A session of reading after lunch and then a project – hammer the 
legs into my last burl table and give the top a good sanding … it is now 
ready for a coat of varnish.

Chapter 5
Dick had exceptional eye-hand coordination and to explain this to visi-
tors at Dick’s cabin, I would show them these tables. It’s easy for the average 
person to take the legs’ stance for granted. But if one leg were different from 
the others then that would be easily noticed and look out of place. 
To create the stance of the legs, Dick would have had a tabletop turned 
upside down, lying on the ground. Standing over the table he would have 
turned his hand auger at the same angle to drill each of the four mortise holes 
that receive the tenoned leg ends. Not only are all the legs splayed to the same 
angle but Dick splayed them just enough to be pleasant to look at. They are not 
too splayed, which would give the tables a squat appearance, nor are they too 
straight, which would give the tables a stilted appearance. Dick drilled one 
hole at a time all without using a guide or other assistance. Finally he drilled 
the mortise holes in the underside of the second tabletop to match the first.
These two tables are also an expression of Dick’s sense of scale and propor-
tion. Each leg is the same size or close enough to feel in scale with the burl top. 
A quality of scale is found throughout Dick’s work including his desk chair, 
beach chair, stool, bench, tables, shelves, ladders and winter sled, as well as 
his cabin and cache. 
June 2, 1969:
Three odd shaped slabs of burl, I would make a fish-cleaning table 
from one. Shaped somewhat like an ironing board so I used three legs 
such as an ironing board has. Some fish scraps for the trot line so I 
baited it up and cast it out.
The slab for Dick’s fish-cleaning table was made from the same spruce burl 
he used for the tops of the two tables he made that reside on either side of his 
Here I’m simulating how Dick would 
have drilled the mortise holes for the 
table’s legs. (Photo by K. Schubeck)

Dutch door. Dick carved a large bowl from the first piece sawn from the burl 
but I have been unable to acquire a photo of it. Two slabs made his matching 
tabletops. His fish-cleaning tabletop was the last slab sawn – which includes 
a section of the trunk of the tree above and below the burl.
August 7, 1971:
Today I would spread part of my quart of Flecto Humicure clear 
plastic finish. $5.95 per qt. in Anchorage. It should be good. Spoons, 
canoe paddles, snowshoes, window ledges, table, counter, shelves, chair, 
heavy tables outside and my dish washing table. I was really spreading it 
on. Very fast drying and would be ready to use by evening.
June 3, 1969:
Another day for more cleaning and burning. Many willow and buck 
brush stubs to be grubbed out. Move part of my wood pile and get the 
saw dust out. What I need is a good rake. A new one lies down at Ralph 
Gatanos cabin site. I would build one. Use nails or spikes for teeth. It is 
finished except for installing the teeth.
June 4, 1969:
I drilled the holes and installed the teeth in my new rake. The only 
rake at Twin Lakes with teeth adjustable for length and replaceable if 
necessary. I gave my diggins a good going over – even the beach is free 
of small trash. A half days work done and only 9:30. I went up and 
raked the potato patch.
June 5, 1969:
A project in mind for today. Do something about my floor. Too 
much coarse gravel to suit. I have raked and leveled and picked up the 
largest but still it could be improved. Dirt working up into it too. I 
would take it out and wash it – screen it and put it back. I dumped a few 
tubs full in the lake which did a good job but I lost too much and picked 
up too much coarse gravel. An idea – take my mortar mixing tub – set it 
at the waters edge and with the slope of the beach – bail it full of water 
and screen the gravel into it. The sawdust and chips went over the edge 
with the water. More water dumped in and the gravel shoveled about 
to get the dirt out. Tip the tub to get the water out. I had good clean 
gravel, uniform in size. Counter clock wise around and every nook and 
corner scraped down to the dirt. Many tubs full back and forth. I put it 
back not so thick which makes a good solid floor.
July 3, 1971:
Another fine morning for the day before the 4th. More odd jobs to 
do before my place was ready for an inspection the 4th. Rake the beach 
and spread more gravel in front of the cabin where it was getting thin.

July 25, 1971:
Some mending to do and my rifle to clean up a bit. Rake my beach 
and trim the shrubbery. Fireweed to pull that was growing in the paths. 
My place looks pretty neat this perfect evening.
August 11, 1971:
This was a really nice morning. I haven’t seen one like it for quite 
some time, or so it seems. Last evening with the lake going down rap-
idly I would have to clear the trash out of the low spot in front while it 
would still float. Wearing hip boots and armed with my rake I reached 
out and dragged the center to shallow water and then pushed it out into 
the lake. It was quite a chore for there was lots of it.
August 12, 1971:
The water low enough now that I could wade along the edge and 
rake the trash into the water. It won’t go anywhere but will be easier to 
rake in as the water drops lower.
July 8, 1972:
The sun up and on its way – I would just get my hotcakes on the fire 
and make a day of it. Saturday and I wouldn’t be surprised if Jerre flew 
over for the weekend. He would have the floats on his champ by now. I 
would get my mail up to date just in case. That out of the way, I worked 
at dressing up my diggins. Rake the beach, the path and area around the 
cabin. Give the gravel a new top dressing where it was thin. Clean up 
the woodshed.
July 30, 1972:
This was one nice morning and was due to be the best day ever. 
Sunday and you never know who might come. I got busy on a few more 
letters. Squared away there and I started a spic & span campaign. Rake 
the beach and it is in the best shape I have ever seen it. Cut the unde-
sirable new sprouts in my front yard. Pull the grass and weeds that was 
crowding my path system. A go around inside the cabin cleaning & 
organizing.
July 27, 1973:
I raked my beach while they washed & dried. Gave orders – no 
sleep walking and tracking up my nice rake job and headed for the 
bunkhouse.
Dick walked to Spike’s cabin for the night having given his cabin to his 
friend, Lucy Benjamin, and her friend, Lindy. I contacted Brie Anderson, 
curator of the Richard L. Proenneke Museum near Dick’s hometown of 
Primrose, Iowa, to help me identify Lucy and Lindy. Brie’s good friend 
Roberta Krehbiel confirmed that Lucy Benjamin grew up in Primrose as a 
 223
Made from Spruce
family friend of Dick’s. Lucy was living in Florida and came with her friend 
Lindy to visit Dick.
Roberta also shared a wonderful story about how Dick’s brother, 
Raymond, acquired the nickname Jake. Raymond once told her, when he was 
a boy, there was an old man who always carried around a bucket with him. 
The man made toy wooden whistles and Raymond wanted to learn how to 
make those whistles, so the man taught him. Because Raymond tagged along 
wherever the old man went, he ended up with the nickname “Jake.” The man’s 
name was Jake Halbasch.
July 28, 1973:
Growled at first thing on reaching the cook shack. “How come you 
didn’t whistle as you walked the beach this morning? We could have 
had your breakfast on the table by the time you got here.” I whistled a 
breath or two and trudged on towards Hope Creek. I didn’t see the fresh 
tracks of the water boy on my fresh raked beach and I wondered if she 
had done that chore. I mentioned it at breakfast and Lucy said I didn’t 
make tracks. The water was fresh alright.
“Now, you kids get some lunch ready and I will go up and hang 
the little kicker on the canoe”. This afternoon (and the last chance) we 
would tour the lower lake. Go all the way to the river. “Kicker? we didn’t 
know you had a motor. Thought you was a purist and shunned all things 
mechanical.” “Well, you have to look at it this way when dealing with 
tourists. I don’t relish the idea of paddling two fat women back from the 
lower end.”
Dick expressed a side of himself with this comment to Lucy. There are 
other references like this in his journals but this is a rare time he spoke some-
thing like this directly to someone. The day of canoeing and also the proceeding 
few days with Lucy and Lindy went well and upon their return Dick con-
cluded the day by journaling the entry below. 
At Spikes bunk house I heated some water, got cleaned up and hung 
my laundry over that little fireball stove to dry. The end of the week the 
first of its kind in “One Man’s Wilderness” I enjoyed it – I hope they did.
K. and I met at least a hundred people who Dick journaled about includ-
ing a few about whom Dick journaled something I read as offensive. All of 
them spoke positively of Dick. 
December 30, 1978:
Much dripping of the eaves during the past week and a build up 
of ice at the front right corner on my pathway to the woodshed. About 
eight inches of snow covered the end over hangs and the eaves. Jim 
Shake’s splitter took care of the ice build up and my home made rake 
dragged the excess snow down to be shoveled aside. The chimney box 
cleared so there will be no more dripping.

May 8, 1979:
Last fall just before freeze up strong winds up the lake had thrown 
up a heavy berm of gravel along my beach. I wanted to shovel it back 
and rake it smooth before the lake came up this spring. How would it go 
with the no. 2 long handle. I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. 
Easier than splitting wood and as easy as sawing.
May 11, 1979:
I got out my rake and bunched up the coarse rocks on my beach.
Raking was good for what ailed me. I could feel my sore spots more 
than when using the shovel. I moved my raked up rocks with the sled 
and called it good.
May 19, 1979:
Fine weather or not I would clean my dirty floor today. I got with it 
as soon as chores were done.
My mortar tub and bath gas can buckets came to the cabin to be 
filled and packed to the beach towards the breakwater. The flow of water 
is down and by now a light breeze down. The dirt would drift away from 
my cabin water dipping spot. Submerge my strainer tub and pour the 
dirty gravel in slowly. 99 and 9/10% of the dirt and trash stays on the 
surface to drift away. Stir the gravel in the tub with my walking stick 
a bit, lift drain, submerge and lift again a few times and it is clean and 
sanitary. Pack it in and screen it on the floor to remove any coarse gravel 
that came up from below. Many tubs full and many times to the beach. 
By eleven I had the job done and a neat looking floor … On the beach 
I screened more gravel to dress up my pathways and area in front of the 
cabin. Rake the beach for the first time this spring season.
May 23, 1980:
A big berm of gravel thrown up. Leave it and it would form an 
obstruction to planes coming to the beach as the lake rises. I would 
pitch the material up the slope of the beach and rake it smooth.
January 15, 1982: 
I would rake the snow from my roof. A foot of snow over the front 
over hang and eaves but very little over the interior of the cabin. Too 
many days of 25 to 30°. So I raked it over the edge and shoveled it aside. 
Broke my homemade rake so that will be a project soon. 
January 16, 1982:
Clearing down country as I came back to work in the woodshed 
salvaging the hard ware of my broken rake.
January 17, 1982:
Cool in the woodshed for the job but I would work at building a 
 225
Made from Spruce
new rake. This one would be stronger where the handle is attached to 
the bar holding the teeth. With the 4 foot one man cross cut I ripped 
the tooth bar out of a seasoned 4" diameter spruce. Designed it to be 
stronger at the center that took a little extra time.
The parts for my rake completed and now I needed two large wood 
screws to fasten the tooth bar to the handle. Bet Spike would have some 
in his collection in Hope’s cabin so I took an armload of cardboard boxes 
and snowshoed up. Twenty years now since he brought them to Twin 
Lakes but there in a Sir Walter Raleigh can with a few nails was two 
large wood screws 21⁄ 2 inches long. Exactly what I needed.
January 18, 1982: 
Ten o’clock before I got everything squared away and ready to put 
my sturdy rake together. Many holes to drill and they should be about 
the right size. Too small would cause splitting and too large a disaster. 
Many thicknesses of newspaper on the carpet to minimize the clean up. 
Holes drilled for tie nails and teeth. The tie nails to keep the 20-penny 
(teeth) nails from splitting the tooth bar. 13 of them in a line would 
surely split the bar but not with a tie nail between each two teeth.
Holes too small for the tie nails and then the holes too small for the 
teeth. Holes augered for the 21⁄ 2" wood screws and I bees waxed the 
screws so they would surely go all the way. I mixed up my sawdust and 
glue bedding compound and coated the seat, in the bar, for the handle. 
Couldn’t get the screws all the way in – didn’t have screwdriver enough. 
Put the vise grips on my church key screwdriver – still not enough. 
Some place I had seen a screwdriver bit for the brace. Here or in Iowa 
I couldn’t be sure. I emptied the tool bag on the carpet and it wasn’t in 
the bunch. Next I emptied the tool (gas) can on the carpet and the tool 
kit bag for the kicker. I had tools on the floor until I couldn’t walk. I 
decided that the bit was at home in the toolbox in the barn better than 
3,600 miles from Twin Lakes.
The screws not in as far as I wanted but close, so I mixed up some 
grout (sawdust and glue) to make it a professional job. Puttied up a few 
other blemishes that resulted from the cookie not crumbling as planned. 
After drying over night I would use a rough file to smooth the rough 
spots and it would be a good rake …
I didn’t make flat rate in putting the fool rake together [it took longer than 
expected] but I could make up for it by cutting and bringing in a dead tree.
Dick’s beach rake is a marvel of lightweight engineering. The handle is a 
small spruce pole and the crossbar was sawn from a spruce log. Drilling holes 
for each “rake tine” nail seems logical to keep the spruce from splitting. Dick’s 
creative use of what he called “tie nails” is what allows the crosspiece to be thin 
without compromising the wood’s tendency to split. His tie nails are put in a 
staggered row to make the crosspiece less likely to split along the tie nails. Dick 
used this same crosspiece when he made a final upgrade a few years later.

Chapter 5
There is a slight jog near the end of Dick’s rake handle, likely where the 
apex of the tree died and one of the top limbs became the tree’s apex as it grew. 
When I was asked to replicate Dick’s rake, finding a matching tree for the 
handle was not an easy task. I welcomed the opportunity to spend time with 
hundreds of young spruce trees with an elevated awareness. Once I found a 
small tree with just the proper jog, replicating the rake was an awakening 
into Dick’s ingenuity of giving structure to this lightweight tool that would 
withstand rigorous use. 
Dick’s rake, no heavier than a garden rake from the hardware store, was 
still in fine condition when it was taken to the archives.
May 15, 1982:
I came back to neaten up my area. Salvage some of the gravel I had 
crowded from my pathways, pull spent fireweed and dead grass, prune 
the bushes in the front yard and rake my pathways and beach.
Walking on gravel pathways gradually rolls the gravel further and fur-
ther from the center of the path. This is what creates wildlife trails and it’s 
what widens the pathways around Dick’s cabin. As visitation to Dick’s cabin 
increased K. and I constantly raked the gravel back to the center of the path-
ways to keep the paths in the condition Dick wished them kept.
July 22, 1983:
I had forgotten about my tracked up beach so when dishes were 
done I took the rake to it and erased all sign of the tourists. Now, the 
upper lake, at least, is “One Man’s Wilderness” again.
August 28, 1987:
My woodpile needed some attention and then I would go over to 
Jerre’s Point and do Gary and Christina a favor [Gary Titus and his wife 
Christina “Chris” Degeneres]. Take my rake, broom and dustpan. Clean up 
the charcoal and other litter on the ice where they had their fire. Pick up 
the metal scraps of roofing the porkies had torn off and rake the area as 
much as the remaining snow would permit. It was past four when I got 
away and I worked a bit more than one hour. My reward was a new large 
size tube of new better tasting “Crest” toothpaste. I left the place look-
ing much better and one more session plus some burning should do it.
April 10, 1990:
I watched to see if Gary was going to climb the mt. today. I was 
over hauling my good beach rake. I needed one bolt 3/8" x 3", two 3/8" 
flat washers and one 3/8" coarse thread nut. That’s a pretty big order at 
Twin Lakes. I went to “Spikes Hardware” on the shelf over the door 
in Hope’s cabin. After a batch of looking and a little bit of finding of 
interesting items such as a can of lighter fluid to hotten up the gas for 
my “Jonee” hand warmer and a little rum in a quart bottle. Probably 
 227

would have been dry if the cork hadn’t been broken off flush with the 
bottleneck. Brandy makes a 100% improvement in Lipton tea and would 
rum do the same. Well what luck — three bolts 3/8" in diameter but two 
of them 21⁄ 2 long. The third one a 3-incher. Three flat washers in stock 
and 3 - 3/8 square nuts. I was in business and here I soon had my rake in 
better shape than when I made it about 20 or 22 years ago. The handle 
fits in a shaped saddle notch. I mixed up Elmers glue and saw dust for 
bedding cement and a perfect fit.
May 13, 1990:
This morning after chores I painted the figures on my water level 
stake and put it over the stove to dry. Now I would install it with 14 
inches being at the water level. Bound to be plane day before long so I 
raked the beach and after lunch my roofs would get another drink.
July 23, 1990:
After breakfast some laundry, rake my beach and if it would rain if I 
did I would water the roof.
November 25, 1990:
Come reveille time I stepped out to sweep the doormat free and 
poke the tape down. 8" it said. After breakfast I got with it and I would 
be most of the day at snow removal. It was dry enough not to stick to the 
shovel that I appreciated. Shovel and then move the top back with my 
good rake. For that job I secured a 4" wide slat of quarter inch plywood 
to the rake teeth to use it like a push broom from the pathway.
January 7, 1992: 
This snowing bit must be habit forming. Not a great amount but 
persistent. The fire, let it die. It only takes a match and a minute to start 
one. My good broom, the hoe-rake and the big shovel makes pretty 
short work of snow removal these days. The water hole well choked with 
drifted snow. The long handle No. 2 fixed that.

March 24, 1993:
The snow in the path way to the lake was deep, wind packed and 
quite a lot of it. A test for my arm. I had to break it up with the no. 2 
then scoop it out and the third treatment was to get on top with my 
big rake hoe and hoe it back – make room for more when it snows and 
blows again.
April 1, 1993:
My roof was dripping at the eaves and I could stop that by removing 
the snow. With the big hoe rake drag it down and drop it on a chunk of 
visqueen – drag it away and jerk the plastic from under it. Near sun set 
when I finished.
May 22, 1993:
The pathways got the broom and the beach the big rake. The roof 
would get six buckets of water today.
November 2, 1994:
The only snow was over the eaves so I installed the hoe attachment 
to my rake and dragged it off onto a strip of black poly. On snow it tows 
very easy and so I dragged it to a good dumping area. Done by noon.
July 23, 1995:
Very good film, he said. He would shoot more than 4 rolls of it here 
in and about the cabin outside. I was busy moving many photogenic 
items out of the camera view. Many times he said “That’s ok. It belongs 
there”. He must have shot a roll or more of me sitting at the table with 
my journal before me and pen in hand. During his work we had both 
the cow barn lantern and the Coleman lit for effect …
Now he wanted me in the canoe and then him in the canoe facing 
me to get pictures of me paddling. “You have the perfect paddle stroke” 
he said … Then he insisted the two women to come kneel beside me. 
They had been busy taking pictures of me too. Finally he said “that’s it, 
we are done”. 
Before they took off Tommy [Tommy Hopl, a German photographer] 
told the pilot he would like an air shot of me standing on the beach by 
the canoe so they made a circle down and came back for a low fly by. 
That was it. I promptly took the rake and raked out their tracks on the 
beach. I was glad that project was finished.
As much as Dick welcomed those who stopped to visit, on more than one 
occasion raking the beach was sometimes his way of reclaiming “One Man’s 
Wilderness.”
Dick’s journal entries about his rake are among my favorites. K. and I 
take Dick’s rake from his cabin to greet every airplane of visitors as they taxi to 
the beach. Talking about his rake and his use of it is how we start most tours.
 229

Prior to Dick returning to his cabin for the last time in 2000, K. and I 
knew Dick kept his beach carefully raked. We had been told “spring cleaning” 
for Dick included washing the gravel from his cabin floor in the waters of 
Twin Lakes. Before Dick’s final arrival to his cabin K. meticulously raked the 
gravel along his 100-foot beach and along his trails to and around his cabin. 
She left not a single spruce cone or tiny twig of organic material along the 
entire beach or on his trails around the cabin and to the woodshed. 
Dick’s vision was likely failing on this last visit but not his wit. When 
he stepped down to the float of the plane, he looked up at me and said, “I see 
you’re not raking my beach.” By keeping the beach raked, Dick could see what 
animals had passed during the night and if a plane or boat had landed when 
he was away for the day. But mostly, raking the beach was Dick’s way of 
maintaining his space the way he wanted it. If I had not been aware of that 
before I certainly knew it now. A few hours later, boarding the park’s Cessna 
185 with Leon Alsworth flying, Dick looked at K. and said, “You rake my 
beach now!”
In 1982, when I visited Dick, he asked me to stay on his gravel trails 
around his cabin. Dick knew the tundra was fragile. Walking over it a few 
times would have no effect but walk over it more and the tundra’s die back 
takes decades to recover. Staying on Dick’s gravel trails is the one thing we ask 
of the many visitors to his cabin today. It may sound ridiculous to ask this of 
visitors in the middle of the wilderness but our goal is for every future visitor 
to have the opportunity to experience Dick’s cabin as he kept it. 
We kept Dick’s beach raked, always raking from the bottom up like Dick 
showed K. Many visitors to Dick’s cabin have shared this simple pleasure of 
raking the beach as well, some imagining Dick and what it was like for him. 
May 28, 1974:
I needed a bridge across Hope Creek. This old business of hip boots 
or canoe just to get on the far side is no good. I took my trusty axe and 
went over to survey the situation. Up from the mouth about a hundred 
yards the creek runs against the bank that is a couple feet or better above 
water level. Gravel on the other side but good height. I found a good 
dead tree no more than a hundred fifty feet away. Tall and straight and 
about eight or ten inch through on the big end. I cut it, limbed it and 
man handled it to the crossing. A scrubby spruce leans out from the 
bank along side my bridge. Something to hold on to half way across.
Dick had various single-log bridges across Hope Creek dating to before 
1967. These bridges crossed the creek where the creek flows into Twin Lakes. 
This bridge is the first he constructed up the creek 200 yards from the lakeshore.
May 16, 1980:
Right away I found a job for today. My skinny bridge across Hope 
Creek had been broken by the settling snow pack. Broke in the middle 
as you would a matchstick. I came back for my big bow saw and pack 
Bridge across 
Hope Creek

Chapter 5
board. Wrestled the inboard ends out of the snow, sawed it to packing 
lengths and packed it to the woodshed. I saw no good tree nearby that 
would make a good bridge log. The closest one was in the little island of 
spruce this side of the mouth of Hope Creek. It would take some doing 
to get it moved and in place.	
Now about my new bridge. I had plenty of good nylon rope and my 
little cable lever hoist. Drop it in the direction of the bridge site, limb 
it, tie on to the small end and drag it the 100 feet plus to the crossing. 
Dropped her and proceeded to drag her to the site. I learned a spruce 
with the bark on doesn’t drag easy in soft wet snow. Get my line as 
tight as a fiddle gut and then lift mightily on the line near the end of 
the pole. It would jump ahead 6-8 inches and then I would repeat the 
process. Got it there but not pointed in the right direction so I had to 
burry a dead man out on the flat to pull the big end around. Then from 
across the creek, hook onto the little end and pull it to get equal footing 
on each bank. A much better bridge than the last one and this one will 
have a support just under the center when it comes time for ice to form 
in the creek.
It seems likely this is the bridge that was still usable, if marginal, when 
Dick left Twin Lakes. It was still being used in 2000 by holding one’s breath.

May 18, 1980:
Better that I should make the day pay a little bit even though it 
was the Sabbath. I climbed to the cache and fished out my drawknife. I 
would peel the sides and bottom of my new skinny bridge log. Leave the 
bark on top for non-slip footing. Jack Ross the cabin builder says leave 
the bark on until you get ready to use the logs. They won’t crack open so 
much. That could be so but I like my logs clean, light and dry. I brought 
back a tub of bark to burn and will get the rest as I need it.
June 7, 1980: 
I would fix that bridge. It’s a neat trick to walk the pole over very 
fast and plenty deep water. If a person was to end up in that creek now 
he would end up in the lake and it would be interesting to learn if he 
would survive. I scouted the jungle for a good straight pole. A green 
one that I could peel and spike along side and flush with the top of 
the bridge log. Big end to small end to get a more uniform width of 
walking surface. Now it is finished and one could walk it blind folded. 
Might save someone a dunking and possibly an injury during the 
tourist season.
June 9, 1980: 
Mid afternoon and the day fair when I got under my pack saddle 
and went for my wood across Hope Creek. The wider bridge is much 
appreciated when you have a good load of wood on your back.
November 4, 1980: 
Now I really appreciate the extra width of the bridge made by 
spiking a pole along side the bridge log. (little end to big end.) Walking 
a skinny pole bridge that is snow covered is some thing but to do it with 
a heavy pack on your back is something else. Just that little extra width 
makes it a crossing first class.
October 24, 1985:
I crossed the skinny bridge and noticed a fox had walked the log 
also. The small end of it little more than 4" in diameter and Mr. fox had 
to place his tracks directly on the centerline.
June 27, 1988: 
Before I had gone down I rigged a pole hand rail at the skinny 
bridge and I felt better because I did. It would be a disaster if some one 
fell in fast flowing Hope Creek.
August 26, 1990: 
After breakfast I went out on the flat to check the creek at the 
skinny bridge. Bad news. My end of the bridge had washed out. The 
232 
	
Chapter 5
small end across was wrapped around a spruce along the bank. The big 
end in the current down stream. The railing pole was also trailing in the 
fast water. Now the creek is too wide to bridge with one skinny pole and 
I do need a bridge there.
Here in front I moved the canoe and would have to move it twice 
more as the lake kept rising. About now I was very thankful that it had 
stopped raining. Had it rained a get wetter today as it did yesterday 
the creek would be covering the creek flat timber to timber as it did in 
the early 70s. I decided I couldn’t help the situation. By now the lake 
was very rough to paddle and I felt sure my bridge log wouldn’t come 
dislodged and go to sea, so, I wrote a letter and read the new Readers 
Digest.
September 28, 1990: 
I put it in place again. Put the handrail pole in place and opened it 
for traffic. The “skinny bridge” is a very necessary link to the far side of 
Hope Creek. It’s a nuisance to use the canoe or hip boots every time I 
went on the far side. Hikers certainly appreciate it.
June 3, 1992: 
The handrail for the skinny bridge crossing Hope Creek needed 
improving before tourist season. I like to have it idiot proof. Before I 
put a rail on it I instructed some spooky people to stay right there till 
I come got a pole. When I got back they had already crossed to prove 
they were brave. No bravery is possible with out fear and they were 
afraid the reason I came for the pole to poke in the creek bottom for a 
third leg. One time I insisted on taking a not very spry elderly lady to 
the other side of Hope Creek by canoe. “No way”! She had to cross on 
the skinny bridge.
June 13, 1992: 
My hand rail on the skinny bridge has too long a span between sup-
ports and insists on sagging so I spent a few minutes putting a stanchion 
in the middle.
October 26, 1993: 
Broom in my left hand and holding the rail with my right I was 
shuffling across the log clearing the rail of snow with the broom and the 
log with my feet. Not paying a lot of attention for I have only crossed 
the skinny bridge about a thousand times. Suddenly I was going down. 
My upper lip below my nose hooked on the rail and got scuffed a bit. I 
was down in the water floundering around. Insulated gloves full of water 
boots full, wet to the waist on one side. Some thing went drifting by 
and I thought it was from my jacket. It was ice broken loose from the 
stanchion supporting the bridge. I was some what of a mess as I came 
trudging back.

November 16, 1993: 
Today I wanted to break trail to the snow gauge stake and the big 
log across Hope Creek. The creek still open so I walked the skinny 
bridge on snowshoes. Now there is an invitation to fall in.
May 18, 1994: 
This morning I would go to Hope Creek at the skinny bridge for a 
bucket of water. That reminded me that I wanted to improve the hand-
rail on the bridge. It will get some use this summer if my mail is any 
indication. Some spooky hikers will feel more at ease crossing it now.
June 5, 1994: 
They told me a little about their work. They both work at a real ritzy 
eating place as waiters. Reservations only and $70.00 per person not 
including the drinks. For a small party of guests $1,000.00 for the meal 
is not considered much. For a big party 5-6 thousand might raise an 
eyebrow but out comes the credit card and the price is forgotten. Tips 
for everyone involved might total $1,000.00.
So I saw them to the skinny bridge and wished them a good trip. 
Believe me Twin Lakes was not like this in the good old days.
Dick was not in control of who flew to Twin Lakes to meet him.
August 17, 1970: 
I have been needing a good cutting board. A gas can box end is 
good but you seldom find one that is not two pieces held together with 
corrugated fasteners. I had a good wide spruce slab that would make 
a nice one. I ripped it one and one quarter inch thick. Trimmed it to 
fourteen inches in length and edged it to nine inches wide. Planed and 
sanded it smooth and rubbed it with bacon grease.
October 9, 1970:
Some mending to do and a batch of wood to saw and split. Sawing 
a real good stick about ten inches through. I could use some new place 
mats so cut three a half inch thick. Marked an eight inch circle and 
trimmed them with the keyhole saw. A smaller disk of corrugated 
cardboard glued to each to prevent splitting. The old ones badly 
soiled by the free loaders last winter went into the wood box.
Dick did not lock his cabin from “ free loaders” when he sometimes 
departed during the winter months. As was common in the Alaskan 
wilderness, Dick never installed a lock to keep people out. To provide 
shelter in emergencies, there was a spirit of not locking cabins in Alaska 
when the owner was gone. Firewood was generally left inside along with 
emergency food. People sometimes found emergency shelter and left cabins 
clean or found the owners to send a gift or thank-you note.

Chapter 5
Some Alaskans take advantage of this tradition of not locking wilderness 
cabins and fly their planes from place to place, staying where they wish, often 
leaving a messy cabin when they depart. Dick returned to his cabin to find 
this more than once.
Dick’s cabin was left open during the winter until the winter of 2015. 
The National Park Service staff had to make a choice between honoring the 
Alaskan tradition of not locking cabins and protecting Dick’s historic cabin. 
The National Park Service now fits a security door to bar entry through-
out the winter. I constructed the door in quick fashion in 2015 using hand 
tools and materials at hand to protect Dick’s cabin after a black bear gained 
entry by opening the latch and pulling the door open. The security door sits 
vertically to cover Dick’s door, requires no hardware attachment to the cabin 
and does not alter the front of his cabin in any way. The security door slides 
into a hidden wooden slot under Dick’s door mats and overhead between the 
rafter poles. The door is heavy and ugly but has been effective at stopping 
black bears from entering the cabin and porcupines from gnawing on Dick’s 
Dutch door and hinges. A new security door redesigned to be better looking, 
stronger, lighter weight and also not requiring any hardware being installed 
in the front of Dick’s cabin would be welcomed by future summer caretakers.
May 2, 1994: 
77 the evening of May 1. Certainly I can do more than 78 on May 
4. How many do I want to do? Lets make it an easy number to remem-
ber. [Dick is asking how many chin-ups he wants to do on his 78th birthday.]

for breakfast but it is no better if as good as smoked red salmon chopped 
fine and mixed with fine diced spuds.
Glen Alsworth Sr. flew to Twin Lakes a few weeks after Dick’s 80th 
birthday and remembering Dick doing chin-ups on his birthday asked, “Did 
you do 80 chin-ups?” Dick replied, “…when I got to 80, I felt so good, I did 
a hundred.”
Spruce was Dick’s primary wood but he occasionally used birch, willow 
and poplar.
April 27, 1978: 
I headed down and ended up on Falls Creek – climbed to the game 
trail crossing, came down the other side. There in the timber the biggest 
surprise in years. Birch trees thirty feet tall. Three of them growing 
from a common stump. Six inches or more in diameter. A porcupine had 
peeled a patch on one. I had seen no more than two birch at Twin Lakes 
and they were very small and no larger than willow brush. I headed 
across to the creek to get located in case I wanted to find them again.
February 22, 1979: 
I had been wondering about that big pile of wood the caribou boys 
had on the ice at their campsite. Still there I would bet and when the ice 
goes so will the wood unless I packed it to the beach and hauled it home 
with the canoe after break up. That would be the easy way. A fine day I 
might just take my little sled and bring back a load.
I was dressed plenty warm for the trip down and it is surprising how 
much warmer it is when trudging along with a hundred pounds of wood 
following. I found the wood still there and more than two good loads. 
A few sticks of birch and I felt sure that they brought it as I knew of no 
birch along the beach. Birch good enough to carve some thing out of 
and I would stash it in a safe place at the woodshed.
April 5, 1979:
After chores and a close inspection of that ladle for the artist, 
Glenda [Elliott]. I decided that it needs more sanding and it took a lot 
of it for the epoxy had stained the wood and I wasn’t absolutely sure 
that a clear finish would match it – so – I sanded it down to clean wood. 
While I was in the business I finished the birch spoon and you can’t beat 
birch for beauty. White as bone and just as smooth.
July 22, 1980:
Any fly fisherman worth his salt should have a landing net to slip 
under those tender mouth grayling. I have never had one or used one. 
Bet I could make one by using Spike’s net fish sack. Cut a nice limber 
willow to make the loop. Cut a crotch stick for handle and legs to lash

the ends of the hoop to. It went pretty good and is now curing in the 
woodshed until he comes.
July 24, 1980: 
I finished the landing net except for installing the net work. Looks 
so nice I may even use it myself when using light tackle.
November 27, 1981: 
Not a cold day to work in the woodshed trimming my two latest 
carvings down to final shape before sanding… It was two before I 
cleaned up the mess and put my woodwork where I could get used to  
its appearance. 
When Dick was too frail to hike into the mountains he started walking 
the beach collecting driftwood in the shape of letters of the alphabet.
K. frequently ended her tours of Dick’s cabin at the alphabet tree by ask-
ing visitors, “Now, how many of you would like to live here for 31 years by 
yourself?” K.’s question and their answers initiated insightful conversations 
about choices Dick made in his life and choices visitors made in theirs. Dick’s 
cabin is for many a revisiting of dreams that remain close to their heart. 
Visitors laughed understandingly when K. would say, “Dick loved when 
people came and he loved when they left.” Dick enjoyed living by himself. 
He found companionship with the wild creatures around him, with visitors, 
through correspondence, and with his journaling and photography.

Berry Pickers
July 31, 1967:
A huge stack of blueberry hotcakes this morning and for once I felt 
as if I didn’t care for another one.
Cube steak (rare) boiled spuds and beans this evening. I had put my 
biscuits in the pan at 2 PM and they were especially good (light and 
very thin crust). I had added berries when I worked the dough. Rice and 
blueberries for dessert. One good thing about my stay at Twin Lakes, I 
have enjoyed every meal even though I prepared it myself.

August 21, 1968:
There are many definitions of living but there is one that I have 
never heard and I think should be added. “Living is picking in a patch 
of very large blueberries after a summer rain.” The leaves hanging heavy 
with water. It is one more little detail to make living in the wilderness 
worthwhile.
August 8, 1974:
I have been planning to build a new berry picker. This one would 
have the picking tines running full length of the bottom to let leaves 
and small garbage fall through. I would build it from a log cabin 1-quart 
syrup can. The bottom would be curved for good scooping action. Use 
some of Jerre’s good copper coated wire for tines but I would have to 
visit his hardware store again as I had only half enough wire.
August 9, 1974:
Now I could work on the patent picker. Seven more tines to cut and 
install. How to keep them spaced properly mid way (on the bottom) 
I gave it a little thought and decided on a strip of gas can tin with 13 
holes for the 13 tines. Space them just right. Crimp one side close to the 
holes this would be the inside. The outside portion wider and bent back 
to lay flat on the tines. The ends up along side of the picker and bolted 
fast – perfect. The handle had been put on top before the tines went in. 
Now all I needed was a batch of epoxy to secure the tines. Another strip 
of tin with holes spaced to get the correct spacing for the picking tines 
out front. It will be removed when the epoxy has set.
August 11, 1974:
The dishes done and still enough light to try that new blueberry 
picking machine. Two cans and two berry pickers went to the Cowgill 
benches. Light was failing but we had them both full (cans & pickers) in 
a short time.
August 12, 1974:
Jake would sort last evenings picking of berries and I worked at my 
much neglected wood pile.
August 10, 1975: 
A pretty morning of an unusual stretch of good weather. I might do 
some good on a long hike if I dared to leave the lake area. Surely Babe 
would come today. 
After hotcakes and small chores I did more epoxy work on my berry 
picker and then I would climb the hump and using the old solid bottom 
picker I would pick a couple 2 lb. coffee cans full. It was no problem 
to fill them but I didn’t find the berries I had expected. The Cowgill

benches both above and below the creek is the hot spot this time. It was 
near twelve when I came down and I would sort them before lunch. 
Mossy green ones, small green ones and leaves that would have been 
screened out with my new picker. Some twigs and moss too but it is 
easily picked out. I rigged up my burlap sack sorter on the beach and 
proceeded to clean up the batch.
August 25, 1975:
It had been quite some time since we picked blueberries and had 
only one gallon in the bank. We would break into that super patch on 
the down country side of Cowgill Creek. We took a gallon can, two 
halves and his picker that holds more than a quart. We had paddled and 
beached at Farmers landing before I discovered that I hadn’t brought my 
picker. I would pick the old reliable way and see how it compared with 
that ultra fancy Lumber Jack picker. The berries still there and ripe. Oh 
boy! such a mess of berries. We both agreed that in our recent touring 
of the lakes we had seen larger berries but not nearly so many in a small 
area. I pulled a Leon on him. I picked the good patch once over lightly. 
I had a half gallon by the time he did but he had more than a gallon by 
the time I put the cover on mine. I picked and ate while he filled his 
picker. I do believe a person could get sick on blueberries without sugar. 
I noticed it before and again this time. They didn’t taste as good by the 
time we headed down.
The lake was calming as we paddled home … Jake cleaned the pick-
ing while I got supper and reported that his picking was cleaner with 
less damage to the berries than mine. Score one for the Lumber Jack 
picker with a careful operator.
A big improvement in my walking gear today [Dick had overworked 
his back building a breakwater to protect the J-3 Cub]. The exercise this 
morning loosened the stiffness considerably and the hike to the blue-
berry patch helped but my knees pained me when kneeling so I picked a 
gallon standing on my head.
September 19, 1975:
More blueberries – we should take Mary [Alsworth] a gallon along 
with the mossberries. I took the Lumber Jack and two cans and headed 
for the hump. Jake followed soon after but minus a picker. He hadn’t 
seen it and figured I had taken both. He would learn all about hand 
picking when the leaves pick easier than the berries. We picked as we 
climbed and was on the summit to finish up. Many leaves on the ground 
now and the fall colors are on their way out. Too bad we can’t have a 
few hours of sunshine to expose some film. My berries got the water 
bath cleaning method and Jake ran his picking down a dry burlap sack. 
A nice bunch of very ripe berries and we had to sample before passing 
them off as fit to eat.

August 26, 1974: 
Bob Acheson and Bob Barnett (when they spent the night here) told 
me of a candle lantern they used to make. One that wouldn’t blow out in 
the wind. While the weather made up its mind I would make one. They 
said, cut a hole in the side of a can and poke the candle up through. 
As it burned down, push it up farther. For mine I used a good bright 
gallon can and mounted it horizontal on top of a half gallon can. The 
smaller can forms a stand and with the bottom cut out you can reach up 
inside and feed the candle higher. Put a plastic cover on the bottom to 
catch any wax that runs down. A disk of foil in the rear of the big can 
to reflect more light. A handle of folded gas can tin which serves as a 
handle on top as well as one on the back. A pretty neat rig and it really 
works. That didn’t take long and the weather improving.
August 28, 1974: 
Supper over, dishes and writing finished by the light of my new 
candle lantern. Blowing pretty good out. An opportunity to see if it will 
blow out.
I found the candle lantern in Weisser’s cabin where Dick stored things 
he was not using. When I found it, I knew in a second Dick made it because 
of the accuracy the half-gallon can was cut to fit the gallon can, the simplic-
ity and grace of the folded gas can handle and the handle’s attachment with 
recycled aircraft sheet metal screws. I hung it in the ceiling of Dick’s woodshed 
where visitors would try to figure out what Dick used it for.

January 18, 1978: 
Good hotcakes using half and half flour and my syrup flavored with 
Helen White’s fancy blueberry concentrated syrup. My chores done 
and what would I do today. With the wind and the snow visibility was 
not good. I decided this would be a stay at home day. I could write a 
few more letters. I have only twenty four to go. I got started reading 
and watching the storm and it was ten thirty before I decided it wasn’t 
paying much dividend. Over haul my chimney which is the best insur-
ance against coming home to find only my fireplace standing. Jerre 
Wills had given me three lengths of heavy galvanized 4 inch pipe. I 
had used one to make it safe (beyond question) going through the roof. 
Regular blue light weight pipe above and below that section and they 
were badly rusted at the seam. First the top one came off and I saw that 
the Chinese hat chimney top was in no better shape than the chimney. 
I would open up the tin bending shop and turn out a new one. Use gas 
can tin for the cap and the band and the new heavier gas can metal for 
the legs supporting the cap. The old one had lasted nearly ten years. I 
wondered what changes “One Man’s Wilderness” would see in the next 
ten. This one would be a new improved design and good for fifteen. The 
cabin did look like a work shop. Door wide open and tools scattered 
about as I cut, corrugated, drilled, and riveted. It was well past noon 
before it came off of the assembly line. Another section of galvanized 
pipe would reach from the stove to the one going through the roof. The 
top section still light weight and I cut it half length to do away with the 
decay. My fire I had pulled and carried outside while I assembled the 
pipe. A pretty neat looking job and I still have one joint of new galva-
nized. Now to get a new heavy galvanized adjustable elbow to have as 
a replacement when the plain Jane light weight blue one goes bad (new 
this spring).
The fire burning merrily again and I heated some water to wash my 
sooty pants.
July 13, 1981: 
This morning I had beans to cook and a batch of syrup to make. 
That and write letters until near noon when the rain stopped and it 
would be a good afternoon to travel the lake. I had a project in mind 
that would pay better dividends. Overhaul my flu system – move the 
center section to the top and put a new section of galvanized pipe in the 
center. Open the tin bender shop and make up a new Chinese hat chim-
ney cap to keep the rain out. I don’t know where the 4 inch galvanized 
stove pipe came from. One spring a few years back I found it in Spike’s 
cabin. No one had used the cabin or mine so how they happened to 
leave the pipe is a mystery. I went to Hope’s cabin where I had the pipe 
stored and came back with it and some packing material to pack Sara 
Hornberger’s empty strawberry, rhubarb jam jars and the monster dipper 
Chimney Cap

that I had just completed. Sara does a lot of cooking and talking so she 
can use it as a food dipper or a conversation dipper. Wrote a letter to go 
with it and tonight finds the package in the mail sack ready to fly.
I got busy with the flu. The pipe was no problem but it took awhile 
to build the new bonnet. This one I made larger and mounted it a 
little higher above the pipe. Once when I was in the cabin I looked at 
my watch on the window ledge. 2:45, gee, I thought it later than that. 
Completed the chimney job and made a new rigging to secure the flag 
to the flag pole and then proceeded to put my tools away.
November 13, 1981 [Friday]: 
Last night I thought of it the 13th. Maybe it would be a good idea 
if I stayed in my bunk today. Went the whole day and didn’t think of it 
again until I was eating supper.
Scattered clouds but I could see the moon as it neared Falls mt. I 
was going to see if it set right or left from the full moon position the 
11th and plum forgot until it was gone. I had ample reason to forget. 
I was having cooking fire troubles. Wood wouldn’t burn, the stove 
wouldn’t draw and it got so smoky I threw the door wide open. Pipe 
was plugged that’s what it had to be and rapping on it with the hammer 
handle wouldn’t loosen it. Thought I would do a neat job of installing 
the new Chinese chimney hat last time and fastened its legs to the inside 
of the chimney pipe with sheet metal screws. So I couldn’t lift it off and 
run a long spruce pole down from the top to drop the build up of soot 
and creosote.

Chapter 6
This morning I would do something about that so chores done I 
took the screws out and the hat off. The pipe seemed half closed and 
about roof level. The pole took care of that. I found a discarded can 
that would slip inside the 4" chimney if I cut the rim off. I did more 
than that I cut it in half or better. Run the cap legs inside and fastened 
them there with the screw as I did when mounting it on the stove pipe. 
Perfect, slip the new adapter inside the pipe an inch (snug fit). Comes 
time to clean the pipe, lift the assembly out and get with the program.
November 16, 1987: 
An easy night and 5:50 reveille. I was surprised to see the 34° and 
the snow settling and would pack good on my trails today. After break-
fast and chores I had a project in mind. I would make a new Chinese 
Chimney hat. Make one like I have never made before but first average 
up the score for the 1st 15 days of Nov. 15. 46° was the morning ave. and 
last year 33.2°. Two years ago when freeze up came Oct. 26th the ave. 
was 4.2°. So, Twin Lakes can have what ever temperature it wants.
My project required that I find a tall juice can 4" in diameter. The 
open end to slip over the 4" chimney pipe. Leave 13/4" to slip over the 
pipe. Cut out three holes 31/2" wide and 4" high equally spaced. That 
leaves three legs 1" wide. Cut out a disk 9" in dia. from gas can tin to 
make the cone shaped cap. Cut to the center on one side and over lap 
the edges 23/4" which makes a cone 21/2" high. Rivet the over lap. Rivet 
a 1/2" strip across the top inside to take the tie wire that holds the cap 
tight to the bottom of the juice can. Drill two holes 1/2" between in the 
center of the bottom that is now the top of the assembly. Loop soft stove 
pipe wire through the bottom up and over the 1/2" strip under the hat 
and back down and through the second hole. Twist the ends together 
and then rotate the cap to tighten the wire. Wind it down until the cap 
is tight to the can. All cut edges were turned and crimped for strength 
and appearance. It looks real neat and is strong. Give it a coat of paint 
and it will be ready for years of service.
November 20, 1987: 
A good night after a good day on the mountain. This morning was 
a Christmas card scene. Hoar frost loaded every tree and bush. A very 
beautiful sight. No ice but during the day I would see small patches of 
lake surface that had lost its shine. A below zero night would close it up. 
This morning I wanted to paint my new chimney top so after chores I 
got geared up to paint it rust red and then sit it on the stove to dry.
May 2, 1994: 
The Chinese hat chimney top for my kitchen stove rusted to 
destruction so I would make a new one of gas can tin and a big juice 
can. Opened up the tin benders shop and worked at it and mosquitoes 
 245

worked on me. Only a few so I used no bug dope. My two robbers came 
and the one I have determined to be the mother one is talking baby talk 
a bit so I am expecting young ones to come later. The chimney top com-
pleted I painted it avocado green and elevated it over the stove to dry. 
When I flew to Twin Lakes in 2000 I was told Dick had a ‘bean can’ 
chimney cap on his stovepipe. I was awed by Dick’s creativity and ingenuity 
in making what he needed with what he had. When restoring the roof of his 
cabin that year I found his chimney cap badly rusted. I both wanted to give the 
new chimney cap longevity and did not think of myself so skilled as to fabricate 
a replacement cap from tin cans with the craftsmanship Dick’s cabin deserved. 
I chose to have a replica made out of copper in a sheet-metal shop to add lon-
gevity. Despite my request that the original chimney cap not be thrown away, 
Dick’s original was lost. Now I realize what a mistake it was to even think of 
replacing Dick’s hand-crafted cap with something made in a commercial shop.
I have worked with metal for as many decades as I’ve worked with wood 
but not as extensively. I once designed and constructed a tiny keyed brass lock 
less than 1/2" in each direction for the stile of a wall cabinet door where the 
door met the cabinet at an angle greater than 90°. Metal working was not 
new for me but my previous work was my own. Arriving at Dick’s cabin I felt 
qualified to replicate anything made of spruce but lacked that same confidence 
with metal.
Today I feel pure joy replicating the objects that Dick found useful for 
living at Twin Lakes. After successfully replicating Dick’s snow shovel, ice 
cleats and more than a dozen items from 5-gallon gas cans, I am no longer 
intimidated trying to match Dick’s metal-working skill. Using one of Dick’s 
journal entries and measurements from the copper cap, which was constructed 
to match the measurements of Dick’s last bean-can cap, I have replicated the 
cap to take a photograph for this book. I used new tin cans rather than any of 
the cans Dick left in Weisser’s cabin. It was a fun exercise and honors Dick’s 
words to Jeannette Mills to “keep it true.” 
In 2004, Todd Engstrom of Thomasville, Georgia, wrote in the guest 
book at Dick’s cabin, “I feel like Dick is on a hike up the valley and will be 
back within the hour to cook up some sourdough pancakes. Thanks for keeping 
the sense of the man.” With the leadership and supervision of Chief of Cultural 
Resources Jeanne Schaaf (and other park staff), Lake Clark National Park 
has kept the inspiration of Dick’s spirit within the wilderness of Twin Lakes 
for future generations. 	
July 6, 1969:
A good day for a project in mind. Yesterday on the right hand shore 
of the lower lake I found a bent up aluminum teakettle. Probably I had 
seen it before but thought it beyond repair. I went ashore and collected 
it. Badly bent and no cover. I would see what I could do. An hour or so 
stomping, taping and prying and it looked pretty respectable. A small 
leak in the front side of the spout but some epoxy fixed that. A cover – it

should project inside to prevent it from falling off when tipped to pour. 
I tried to make it in one piece but no satisfactory job. A can 5 inches on 
the outside would just slip in. A one-pound coffee can just emptied of 
bacon grease. The bottom and 1/2 inch sides with a 1/8-inch crimp at the 
edge to stiffen it. A 6-inch disk cut from gas can tin – the edge crimped 
and corrugated enough to give it a slight angle (down). A good man 
sized wood knob of spruce with two bands of my patent wire hose clamp 
(no twisting). Two turns around with the second turn covering an over-
hand knot. Smooth and never loosen. Installed with a large sheet metal 
screw. The coffee can bottom centered and drilled for five 1/8" rivets.  
A neater teakettle lid manufactured in the wilderness I have never seen. 
A good scouring with Comet and it is a kettle to be proud of. A fifty- 
dollar job at Kodiak welders but labor is cheap at Twin Lakes.
December 5, 1978:
While I was trying to make soft beans out of hard ones I dug out an 
S.O.S. pad and gave my aluminum cookware a good polishing. That old 
residenter of a teakettle really sparkles when I apply the pressure.
August 5, 1981:
Daylight came very early. I was up at five ten but didn’t intend to 
travel today. I had mail that I hadn’t had a chance to open. I wanted 
to… rebuild my old teakettle. The forward bail bracket was breaking out 
of the kettle. Poor beat up old residenter but I wouldn’t trade it for a new 
one. Something repaired to good serviceable condition fits the cabin and 
the wilderness.
December 8, 1981:
I noticed my old residenter teakettle hissing at times as if leaking 
a drop on the hot stove so I emptied it and dried it after locating the 
crack. Scrape it clean on the inside and a little epoxy fixed it.
January 15, 1982:
The old residenter was about 12 yrs. old – time it was begging for a 
new one.
August 21, 1983: 
Hotcakes with lots of blueberries on top to start my day. This would 
be a bean-cooking day and I hoped, a letter writing day too. But my old 
residenter teakettle has been giving trouble. The bottom wearing thin 
around the edge. Too often I have been hearing the sizzle that says it’s 
leaking again. Epoxy plugged the leaks but new ones developed. Maybe 
I could put a new bottom on the monster. It would have to be a gas can 
tin which would make for fast heating if not a long life. Beans bubbling 
and seasoning lined up on the counter, waiting. I turned my attention 
 247
Tin Cans
to the hot water system. The bottom of a square gas can just not quite 
big enough but if I uncurled the crimp around the edge it would be. The 
sides had been soldered in the crimp and the sides had been cut close to 
the bottom. So – there was a 1/4" sliver of tin to un-stick. My little blow-
torch camp stove took care of that in a minute. Set the kettle on and trace 
a circle. Cut it 3/8" larger and then use the corrugater to make it a shal-
low pan. Cut the bottom out of the kettle and set it in. A good snug fit 
and even better when I closed the small gaps. Epoxy around the standing 
edge to go down between the sides. Elevated over the stove it was soon 
dry to the touch. Another shot to fill the low spots and a third to make it 
a non-leaker for sure. It looked real good and I was anxious to give it the 
severe test. My tools put away, I was ready to finish the bean cooking.
December 19, 1985:
My good teakettle sprung a leak in its gas can tin bottom. Poor old 
thing, I should retire it and get a new one but L.L. Bean has only the 2 qt. 
size and that isn’t enough. Besides this one has had as much Twin Lakes 
experience as I have. If it has about had it how about me? I would cut the 
bottom out leaving 3/4 inch at the outside to weld a new flat bottom to. 
Good old epoxy would be my welding agent and I have often wondered 
if any ill effects can result from using epoxy glue in repairing my teakettle. 
One time at Terry & Vics [Gill] camp on Bonanza Cr. Terry had a spout 
for a Jerry (G.I.) [government issue] gas can break loose from the threads. 
Did they have any epoxy. Yes, a new kit never used. So, I did a first class 
job of repair but not in the cabin. A health hazard according to Terry. Do 
not use near the kitchen. Any way this repair job exposes very, very little 
epoxy to the water inside. Done and it looked good.

December 30, 1985: 
… then dug out L.L. Beans catalogue to take one more look at the 
neat cast iron tea kettle. $30.00 post paid but only two quarts. If it was 
three I would order one. I took another look at mine – put a couple cups 
of water in it. Leaks, lots of leaks. I took it and my thin Denver butcher 
knife outside. I was surprised when the bottom came off easily – a very 
poor seal with the quick setting epoxy. I cleaned both surfaces and 
started thinking.
January 2, 1986:
I had completed breakfast when it started to spit snow. I sat down to 
write letters and study my Cumberland General store catalogue. It had 
occurred to me yesterday that they would surely have a good teakettle. 
Scads of teakettles, aluminum, cast iron, graniteware (blue), copper or 
stainless. Anywhere from 2 quarts to 81/2 quarts. Prices from $42.18 for 
a big cast iron to $13.74 for a polished aluminum one holding 5 quarts. 
That one’s for me. “Cumberland General Store” wish and want book. 
Most everything that was popular back in the good old days before 
automobiles. How about a 6-quart hand cranked ice cream freezer for 
$104.95 or a little hand cranked coffee mill for $29.95 or a ceramic pie 
bird for $3.65. Place in the center of a pie with crust to let the steam 
escape preventing a soggy crust or a hand cranked cream separator for 
$708.68, or a set of heavy team harness for $1,194.38, or a 3-seater 
fringe top surrey with hard rubber tires for $4,975.00 picked up at our 
dock, Crossville, Tennessee.
Dick retired his old teakettle after 17 years of use and many repairs. In 
1987, Dick recycled the spout from his old teakettle onto a one-gallon can to 
pour gas for his kicker (the motor for his canoe). The handle to his “old resi-
denter teakettle” hangs on the wall of his woodshed.
October 4, 1968:
After the big tour yesterday this would be an easy day – small chores 
about the cabin. Beeswax the lower grip of the canoe paddle. Make a 
pouring spout for my lantern filling gas can that doesn’t dribble down 
the side.
August 23, 1975:
We wanted some camping footage. We had brought Jerg’s little 
orange tent and a camp cooking kit. A nice little camp ground near a 
knoll would be our location. The tent pitched a fire going and the cub 
resting its heels on the beach. It made a pretty picture and I couldn’t 
imagine getting paid for doing this.
Dick’s “camp cooking kit” included one interesting and revealing hand-
crafted item. Dick and his brother Jake staged a photograph of Dick sitting 
next to their campfire, Jerg’s orange tent tucked back between the trees, the J-3 
The handle to Dick’s “old residenter 
teakettle” still hangs in his woodshed.

Piper Cub heeled up and tied off to a spruce, Dick’s Bolex movie camera on 
the heavy tripod with beautiful mountains in the background. On the gravel 
in front of the fixings laid out for preparing dinner sits a newly painted coffee 
can with an elegant green handle. I think the handled can with lid was Dick’s 
water container, pure drinkable lake water only feet away. Dick likely put the 
handle on the can before painting it green to take along on the camping trip. 
He was taking photographs and film for the National Park Service, to pro-
mote this wilderness country for inclusion into a new national park in Alaska.
I found this can in Weisser’s cabin in 2000. The condition of the green 
paint told me it had only been lightly used before being put away. Dick folded 
thin gas-can metal into multiple layers to make a stiff graceful handle for the 
lidded can. Thinking this can had a story to tell about Dick’s life, I moved it 
to his cabin where it has stayed for visitors to see. The recently found camping 
photos told me the can’s story. I think Dick kept this handcrafted can “unused” 
after his camping trip with intent, maybe a memory of a special summer with 
his brother. For me, it symbolizes the connection of Dick’s handcrafted life to 
the creation of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.
June 12, 1987: 
I needed a can with a good pouring spout so what could be better 
than my old tea kettle spout on a gallon can with bail.
June 13, 1987: 
This morning saw my pouring spout bucket complete. I want it for 
filling my little kicker gas can fuel tank.
November 16, 1991: 
I needed a pouring spout on a one gal. square (rectangular) gal. can 
to handle my lantern fuel better. So, I opened the tin smiths shop and 
turned one out. Epoxy was my solder.

Chapter 6
Dick was constantly making items to use or give away. Many were left 
hidden on the back of shelves, or in gas-can boxes in out of the way places. 
Many of Dick’s handcrafted items did not get a mention in his journals. 
Throughout our many years as tour guides for Dick’s cabin at Twin Lakes, 
our desire was to understand the man whose life inspired travelers to visit this 
remote site. Returning for 19 summers, more and more of Dick’s handcrafted 
items were woven into our awareness and into the tours. Items including the 
pouring can made from a pink grapefruit juice can, the little skillet with a 
Nestlé lid, and numerous trays and lids from the ends of cans found a place on 
the stage of understanding Dick’s life. Dick always rolled the edges of the tin 
to make the items friendly to touch. His cabin was a touching museum during 
our summers and it was easy to see visitors’ reverence for Dick’s life as they 
held items he made and used.

“There are many definitions of living but there is one  
that I have never heard and I think should be added. ‘Living is 
picking in a patch of very large blueberries after a summer rain.’  
The leaves hanging heavy with water. It is one more little detail   
to make living in the wilderness worthwhile.”  
– Richard Proenneke
The Elgin &  
the Arctic Tern
“Paddling the canoe on rough water – no life jacket.  
Perhaps I have been lucky but I have a lot of confidence in  
my craft. Stay on the bottom, add a few stones for ballast.  
I may not hit the beach where I would like too but I will  
land on shore and won’t be wet when I do.”  
– Richard Proenneke

Dick Proenneke’s years at Twin Lakes are synonymous with his reliance 
on hand tools – no chain saw and no generator. He flew a Piper J-3 Cub 
airplane that he and Raymond called the “Arctic Tern.” This airplane and 
his occasional use of a Sears outboard motor on his Elgin canoe are exceptions 
to his no-power-equipment story. This chapter weaves the story of Dick’s use 
of both the Arctic Tern and his Elgin canoe with a Sears kicker, told through 
his journals. 
Dick’s use of his airplane and canoe motor does not diminish his living 
a handcrafted life. He lived in the 20th century and as boys in Iowa, he and 
Raymond thought of flying together. Where better to realize that dream than 
exploring this remote wilderness. The little outboard motor provided safety 
when canoeing the changing conditions of Twin Lakes.
June 15, 1967: 
I launched the canoe and paddled around to the point to pick up the 
line and the scraps that lay on a rock just offshore. I came in bow on and 
moved forward to get the scraps. The stern swung away a bit and it was 
a good reach. A minor mishap – the second of the season. As I reached 
the canoe tipped throwing my weight on the low side and over it went. 
The next thing I knew I was on my knees in the sand – (water over knee 
deep) and my head and shoulders were inside the canoe that was upside 
down. I rolled it off and with a few uncomplimentary words about 
myself and much gasping for breath I waded ashore – dragged the canoe 
up on the beach, dumped the water out – flung the fresh bait out into 
the lake – launched the canoe – put out the line – paddled ashore and 
proceeded to go get dried out. My Frisco jeans needed washing anyway 
so I heated some water and did some laundry while I was about it.
July 4, 1967:
My canoe paddle is giving out, cracks at both sides on the lower grip 
and I have heard it crack many times under ordinary paddling strain. 
I might just chop out a new one. Make it 51⁄ 2 feet instead of 5 and the 
blade a bit longer and wider. Make the lower grip a bit heavier.
I took my axe and pack board and paddled down to the Farmer’s 
property line and went up to Fred Cowgill’s saw yard. Some lengths of 
logs there well seasoned and also some heavy slabs. I might find one of 
those with enough wood in it. The logs were too short and the slabs full 
of knots so I packed out a four-foot log for fire wood and came back. I 
had been thinking of a dead tree but why not a green one. It would be 
easy to work and not apt to be checked. I went back to the cabin log 
timber and picked a nice 7-inch spruce with no limbs up the first 51⁄ 2 
feet. I chopped it down and trimmed it. Stood the remainder against 
a tree and packed out the six feet. A heavy log for maybe four pounds 
of the finished product. I scored the sides and made the chips fly. Get 
the blade first. Turn it a quarter turn and get half of the shaft. Turn it 
 253

again and get the other side. Then the edges and the grip. The chips 
were really stacking up but it was shaping up pretty good. Green spruce 
really works nice with a very sharp axe. Trim it a bit more here and there 
as needed. Use the pocketknife and rasp then scrape it with axe blade 
and knife. I took it down to the beach and rubbed it on a sandbar that 
helped to smooth it a bit. Rubbed the grips with Beeswax and it is ready 
for business. A bit heavier than the other but it will get lighter.
July 5, 1967: 
A breeze coming down the lake, a good time to try out the new 
canoe paddle… The paddle was really all right. I know that I can make 
better time than with the old one. Shorten the time from the upper end 
of the lake by fifteen minutes.
The breeze was picking up coming down the lake and grey clouds 
were building up to the south. I made real good time coming down.
I worked on the paddle a bit more. Singed the whiskers off and 
rubbed on a coat of bees wax. It really wears smooth at the lower grip 
where the shaft rubs the gunnels of the canoe.

August 15, 1967: 
Spike, Hope [Carrithers] and the little beagle Missie climbed out 
– back to Twin Lakes once more … Lots of gear and supplies. A new 
canoe paddle – a good looking one, five and a half feet long.
September 3, 1967:
Suddenly Jake said, “there it is” the fire across the lake. We hurried 
up to the canoe.  Spike and Hope were out. Spike offered us the use 
of the motor. We would paddle – good exercise I said. Spike allowed 
we would get it too as the lake had a few whitecaps and water slopped 
into the canoe as it lay along the sandy beach. We shoved off for white-
fish point – down country from our destination but it would give us a 
favorable sea until we hit quieter water on the other side. A bit of water 
splashed on the seat Jake was sitting on but other than that it was a dry 
crossing. Dick and Randy [Weisser] had a big fire going – expecting to 
spend the night there. I gave them their choice. Randy asked me a very 
intelligent question. Had I ever crossed in as rough water with four in 
the canoe. I admitted I hadn’t but had traveled in rougher water with 
two and a good load of equipment, horns, skins and meat of sheep. I 
allowed it wasn’t too rough and besides we would have the waves on our 
stern quarter so it wouldn’t be sloppy. It was a dry crossing with Jake 
getting the seat of his Levi’s only a bit wetter. We angled up the lake – 
making shore above the point and in quiet water. Spike and Hope were 
on hand to greet us.
Dick Weisser likely asked Dick Proenneke in advance for a canoe pickup 
when he saw fire across the lake.
September 4, 1967: 
Six o’clock – the caribou hunters [Dick and Randy Weisser] were 
sleeping in this morning … Down the trail to the log yard and my cabin 
site – then up the beach to the caribou hunters cabin again. Today was 
the day to go home and they had slept in a bit. “Boy! We really appre-
ciated Spike and Hope’s warm cabin and good food after crossing the 
lake” Dick [Weisser] said.
Shortly after lunch a plane and it was the Widgeon. He tried to 
come up on the beach in front of the Weisser cabin but the boulders 
were too big. We had to push him off. He tried the beach in front of 
my cabin site and climbed out in good shape. What is the news from 
outside, I asked the pilot. Same old stuff, you haven’t missed anything 
he answered. Everyone is catching a cold and I noticed that he had one. 
Mrs. Weisser had come along and with Hope as guide made a quick 
tour of the cabin.
Everything was aboard – “the rest is down at the lower lake” Dick 
[Weisser] told the pilot. What is at the lower lake, he asked. “The cari-
bou” Dick answered. I can’t take any caribou with four people and their 
Dick’s Sears 31/2-hp motor. (Photo by

gear said the pilot. Dick [Weisser] suddenly looked older and I could 
understand after knowing what they had been through to get in a one-
day’s hunt. Well, then I guess we would go down and bring it up. The 
Widgeon was off for Kodiak.
The wind was kicking up. Spike put the gas paddle on the stern 
of the canoe. Jake and I would go as there would be some heavy pack-
ing if we couldn’t travel the lower lake. We shoved off angling across 
to whitefish point hoping to find smoother water on that side. It did 
improve a bit and we could run at half throttle without getting wet. That 
little Sears 31⁄ 2 horsepower kicker does a nice job. It may burn a little 
gas but I think it saves on groceries. We would run the stream and tow 
her back through. The lower lake was rough and there were fair sized 
rip tides where the current poured into the lower lake against the wind. 
We beached the canoe at the mouth of the stream and would back pack 
the caribou to there from a ten-minute hike down the lower lake. The 
sky was clearing fast and it was a beautiful view from the bluff both up 
and down country. We found the butchered caribou without delay. It 
had been cut in half around the middle. I lashed both hindquarters and 
the head and antlers on my pack board and Jake took the front quarters, 
ribs, heart, tongue and liver on his. Now for pictures. I was asked to 
pose this way and that, up country and down with more than a hundred 
pounds on my back. Finally we headed up country and for the canoe. 
It was a good pack and as Jake posed for a picture with his load by the 
canoe I noticed his face was glowing. A good load for a city boy. We put 
a long line on the bow – lashed the paddles together blade to blade to 
Dick’s Elgin canoe at the breakwater 
on the down-country side of the beach 
in front of his cabin. The moose skull 
is slowly being gnawed by porcupine.

make a pole to hold the canoe out into deep water and was off headed 
up stream. Walking the shelf of boulders along the channel we had no 
trouble at all – he towing and I holding the canoe out at two paddle 
lengths. It was much more calm on the upper lake than when we went 
down. Paddle or use the motor, I ask. I’m game for either Jake answered. 
It would have been a pleasure to paddle slowly up the middle of the lake 
now lighted by the sun. The fall colors on either side was something to 
see. It was getting late so we used the kicker and was at the beach on 
Carrithers point in thirty minutes. The meat hung on the meat pole and 
protected from flies – it was time for supper. Smoked spare ribs, some of 
Babe’s hard to cook beans (boiled all day) and very good, boiled spuds, 
lettuce, spice cake and fresh blueberries. A very good meal.
John Erickson, a friend of Dick’s, researched the history of Dick’s canoe 
and motor. Spike Carrithers likely bought both the motor and the Elgin canoe 
from Sears in the early 1960s.
Aluminum canoes have an interesting history. As WWII came to an end 
there was an excess inventory of aluminum sheeting and other parts no longer 
being made into aircraft. Elgin, much like the aircraft maker Grumman, 
started manufacturing canoes. The rivets in Dick’s canoe are part of the excess 
aircraft rivet supply at the end of the war. The nuts holding the tubular alu-
minum thwarts to the gunnel are excess aircraft manifold nuts.

Soon it will be one year to the day since I carved out the canoe pad-
dle. I’m sorry to say it didn’t quite last the year. A couple evenings ago

Chapter 7
when I went fishing down country I took it out of traction on the beach. 
I noticed it had a reverse curve to the shaft and as I started to paddle 
it didn’t work quite right. I rested the blade on the gunnel of the canoe 
and with the grip in one hand I pushed down in the center of the shaft. 
A sharp report and I had two pieces in my hands. It had done well but 
had a tendency to warp. I went to the cabin dug the new one from under 
the bunk. The first time that I had used it.
I regret not remembering the name of the visitor to Dick’s cabin who 
asked about Dick’s canoe paddle. After I told him Dick’s paddles were leaning 
against the foot of his bunkbed, the visitor wanted to know about the paddle 
Dick made. 
I remembered a piece of spruce by a tree near his woodshed. The two of 
us looked at it and easily determined it was the blade of Dick’s handcrafted 
canoe paddle. Then I remembered a round stick of spruce with a perforated 
tin can nailed to one end, tucked between the rafter poles in Dick’s woodshed. 
From my first summer at Dick’s cabin many visitors, including myself, had 
speculated on Dick’s use of the perforated can with a handle. I never heard a 
plausible use. But now as I held Dick’s canoe paddle blade I knew the shaft of 
the paddle was this stick with a can nailed on the end. The end of the shaft was 
carved as the handle for a canoe paddle – the grain of the wood in the blade 
and shaft matched. We had answered the visitor’s question of Dick’s canoe 
paddle. This was one of the numerous times a visitor’s collaboration helped me 
understand Dick’s handcrafted life.

The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
I thought I would never learn Dick’s use of the upper end of his canoe 
paddle shaft with the perforated can until I re-read all of the letters Dick 
wrote to me. His letter from December 21, 2000, included, “My outhouse 
flooded at breakup time. I made a tool to clean it and used it often – no prob-
lem there. The outhouse at Spikes saw much use and seems to be standing the 
use. Hopes was never used much.” 
Any tool Dick used multiple times at his woodshed, he would have stored 
at his woodshed. The canoe paddle shaft with the perforated can is uniquely 
designed to clean his outhouse hole in the spring when the hole was filled with 
water. Dick’s letter also supports visitors telling us Dick did not use his out-
house but instead used Spike’s outhouse. Visitors told us Dick’s outhouse was 
primarily a women’s facility and therefore wasn’t frequently used.
In a letter dated September 16, 2000, shortly after his return to his broth-
er’s home from his final trip to Twin Lakes, Dick wrote, “My outhouse in the 
woodshed I cleaned often and finally filled the hole with ashes. In spring, melt 
water would fill it to ground level. That I didn’t like. Liked it better as is. 
Do you approve?” Dick had not minded providing an outhouse for guests and 
cleaning up later but his letter clearly told me he wanted to depart Twin Lakes 
without leaving someone else to clean up after him. I was surprised to find the 
hole as clean and sanitary as if it had never been used when, in 2003, John 
Branson and I lifted the woodshed and outhouse to replace the rotted bottom 
logs. Dick left the tapered disc from cutting the small hole in 1968 back in 
place. He hoped his outhouse would remain unused. I fasted a board under 
Dick’s tapered disc to close the outhouse and built a new visitor facility in the 
forest away from Dick’s historic cabin.
Dick should have picked a larger spruce for his canoe paddle. By making 
the paddle from the middle of a 7"-diameter log, the pith (center of tree), 
became the center of the paddle’s shaft. Tiny knots from the tree’s youth radi-
ated from the center of the shaft and splits developed as the pith shrank during 
drying – both weakened the paddle’s shaft.
August 12, 1968:
By the time I reached the canoe there were whitecaps all over the 
place and that seventh wave was a big one. I could leave it on the beach 
and walk or give it a try. I shoved off angling for the gravel bank. Pretty 
tough going and I was only quarter the sea [paddling at a 45° angle]. When 
I swung head on to come up along the beach it took some strong pad-
dling. If I could make it to Low Pass bite I would beach her and I made 
it. Nice and calm behind the steep beach and I stretched out on the gravel 
for a few minutes. Just as well go eat those blueberries. Many of them 
dead ripe and I ate until I was full. About $1.20 worth at L.A. prices.
Maybe I could line the canoe up along shore. I stripped it of all the 
small line and cord tied here and there. Tied a line to the bow and the 
other two thirds of the way back. Adjust the lines so the bow was out 
farther and start walking. It worked real well. The canoe staying out

far enough to clear the rocks. Except when the direction I traveled was 
broadside to the wind and then she came ashore – so I got in and fought 
it to the next favorable towing beach. I was getting home. Finally I came 
to the stretch of no beach and big boulders. I took to the open water. 
The waves not quite so high and a break in the wind now and then.
August 23, 1968: 
I would take the canoe and go for a short cruise. Only a short way 
up the beach and fresh caribou tracks. I back tracked a few steps and 
learned that a cow and calf came out of the brush and headed up coun-
try. I rounded the point and thought wouldn’t it be something if I saw 
the pair. About then from behind the next point a cow followed by a 
calf stepped out into the water and started swimming across. I turned 
and ran for my cameras which took but a very few minutes. By the time 
I reached the canoe I could hardly see them. This would be a race. I pad-
dled hard and yet I wasn’t sure I could catch them before they reached 
the far shore. Finally I could see more detail of them and could tell they 
had seen me. Heads turned now and then as they looked back. I caught 
them about 400 yards from the far shore. The cow in the lead and the 
calf very close behind. What a beautiful sight in the morning sun. I 
pulled along side and a bit ahead. The pair turned and headed back. I 
didn’t know how tired they might be so turned and passed them again. 
They headed for shore this time. Such strong swimmers I have never 
seen. The cow pushed up quite a bow wave as she raced for shore. I took 
movies and one still but it was just about more than I could manage 
to keep up and work cameras too. They reached shallow water and the 
beach on the run crashed through the brush and up the slope. A demon-
stration of endurance if I ever saw one.
September 6, 1968:
… shoved the canoe in the water and took down the lake. A nice 
breeze to help me down and slow me back. I had put two good-sized 
rocks in the bow. I find it makes the canoe handle much better in the 
wind and give it momentum against the wind.
August 28, 1969: 
No day for traveling. In search of something real satisfactory to 
coat the canoe paddle shaft where it rubs the gunnel I tried epoxy filled 
cement. I had used ski wax but it soon wears off. I scraped it down to 
bare wood and gave it the epoxy treatment. It looks good.
September 7, 1969:
Another coat of epoxy filled cement for the canoe paddle shaft. At 
last I have found some thing that will last on the paddle. No more scuff-
ing of the wood at the lower grip. The broken fins on the kicker to epoxy 
in their proper position.
 261
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
Dick’s epoxy worked well. The broken fins are still intact. The fins help 
keep Dick’s air-cooled outboard motor from overheating.
September 19, 1969: 
Blowing pretty good down the lake. White caps all over the place. 
A good day to go down into caribou land again. Farther this time – at 
least to the Butte up country from dark lake. Stay over night if there are 
good bulls not too far away. I loaded up – sleeping bag, a few rations 
and spotting scope with all of my camera gear. This was my last chance 
this fall. I shoved off and was no more than a hundred yards out when 
I was tempted to turn back. A strong wind from the high mts. could 
only mean one thing. Weather was headed this way and it could blow 
for days. It might be a cold trip to the lower end and one to remember 
getting back. I had always made it back and never left the canoe. Soon 
I was among the white caps and really sailing. Fifty minutes to the 
connecting stream. 
September 20, 1969: 
I hadn’t slept very well with all the racket. On the lake – still blow-
ing and plenty rough, paddling was out of the question. I could line it 
along shore but some places the wind would be directly on shore. I could 
leave it and walk back for it when it calmed … It would take nearly a 
half-day to walk to my cabin and nearly a day to come get the canoe. I 
would see what I could do. As I suspected I couldn’t line it in the strong 
on shore wind. It had to be headed into the sea or waves would break 
over the side. I was wet in no time – pushing it along the beach and I 
had to be closer to the bow than stern to keep it headed into the sea. 
That put me in deep water – over my boots much of the time. A good 
long stretch of this and better going. I dumped the water from the canoe 
and emptied my boots and wrung out my sox and pants. Fair going with 
only one more stop to wring things out. The waves got smaller and soon 
I was lining it right along.
The upper lake. It was something. Very rough and the wind strong. 
I lined to Emerson creek but the wind was on shore from there on. I 
decided to cross to the other side. At least I could walk if I couldn’t 
make it. I ended up on the beach no more than a couple hundred yards 
from the stream. Into the water again and waves slopping over the bow 
now and then. I pushed the canoe broad side in front of me – bow to the 
sea. Nothing but boulders on the bottom and the water near waist deep. 
I could line it for a quarter mile along the gravel bank and then the seas 
got too big and I beached and wrung out again. I just couldn’t make it 
on the water. If I was to travel it had to be on the beach. With paddle 
and walking stick I made a yoke and got the canoe on my shoulders. 
The wind gave me a bad time. The canoe was like a sail. To the narrow 
stretch of beach with big boulders. I could pack it no farther. A trip for 
my gear that I took to protected Low Pass beach.
262 
	
Chapter 7
Back to the canoe and I watched my chance – shoved off and 
paddled hard. A battle but soon I was on the sandy beach. Some quick 
energy honey and a survey of the situation. Not to far to come after it 
here but maybe I could still make it. I lined it where I could and then 
loaded up and packed every thing to the next favorable beach. I was 
gaining and the seas getting smaller. Finally I shoved off and paddled 
hard. Tough going until I was under the bank below Farmer’s cabin. 
While the canoe rested in quiet water by Hope Creek I got a good drink 
of water and a good chunk of chocolate. Never had my cabin looked so 
good. Two fifteen when I beached. Seven hours and forty five minutes 
to make the trip. A good experience but once is enough. Next time 
when the wind blows down from the high mountains and the sky is 
clear I will trudge up Hope Creek – maybe see a bear.
June 18, 1970:
I came back and was really shocked to see that the canoe was miss-
ing. A piece of 1/4" rope still tied to the brush. Well how about that. 
Marks in the beach gravel where it had rolled towards the lake. From 
the marks it appeared to have hit the water right side up. The sponge 
lay at the water edge a few yards away. A gust of wind during the night 
had flipped it over. I had noticed the rope was frayed when I tied it and 
figured it could stand a new one. I set up the scope. All that I could 
see was surf bashing against the many rocky beaches all the way to the 
lower end. Unless it hit a sandy beach it would be well battered and 
probably ruined. Ten o’clock, no time to lose. I gobbled a sourdough 
sandwich and took off. No hip boots but my insulated rubber socks for 
any short time I might be in the water. Where would I find it? From the 
looks of the wave action it would be about Low Pass creek or the gravel 
bank and if not there at the beach on the lower end. If it had filled with 
water on rolling in it would drift slow and the short paddle lashed inside 
would work out. I looked for it along the beach. Low Pass and the gravel 
bank and no sign. My hopes began to fade. Nothing at the beach on the 
lower end. I spotted six head of caribou along the connecting stream. 
Four bulls with antlers well along and a cow with a fine looking calf. I 
stopped to watch them with the glasses. Why, I don’t know but I looked 
across the mouth of the lake and there was my old friend the tin-can-oe 
parked on the beach no more than 60 yds from the stream. At the 
waters edge – bow up lake. Surf splashing over the side. It couldn’t have 
picked a better beach to land on. I circled down wind of the caribou so 
they wouldn’t get my scent. They spooked and circled in land. I went 
down to the fording spot near the lower end of the stream. Something 
told me this would be a cool crossing and not once but twice. I could 
have paddled across the mouth but had left some gear that would be on 
the wrong side if I did. It was very rough and not a chance to paddle 
home. My rubber sox to replace my shoe pacs. It would be deep so I took 
 263
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
my pants off. Not one but two channels to cross and I am certainly glad 
there wasn’t three. I was about paralyzed with cold. Got my shorts wet 
in the crossing too.
I found the canoe full of water and about 2 gal. of sand in the bot-
tom. No danger of it going farther – I couldn’t begin to dump it. A pole 
laid across and tied to a thwart on my side did the trick for a lever. No 
damage except for a light scuffing where it worked the gravel until it was 
filled with water. In a hollow behind the bank and tied to a spruce. It 
would stay until I came the first calm day. I checked O’Connell’s cabin 
and found it in good order … I felt good about finding the canoe in good 
shape and didn’t mind the hike home against the wind and sprinkles. 
September 26, 1970: 
I sanded and filed some scuff marks on the canoe bottom. Filed the 
keel smooth to make her as fast and easy to paddle as possible.
October 18, 1970:
Another coat of epoxy filled cement for the shaft of the canoe paddle.
November 20, 1970: 
The canoe looks out of place on the beach with so much snow but it is 
the best transportation until the water gets too thick to stir with a paddle.
June 13, 1971: 
Now those miserable bears. I hated to walk that rocky beach for 
a good six and one half miles (one way) plus fording the stream at the 
lower end. Only three quarters of a mile and 20 minutes straight across. 
The thing to do was to set my judgment on minimum and my interest 
fortitude on maximum and travel the rotten ice. Using the canoe I got 
on the ice and checked it at a hole close in, 30" was the thickness. Very 
spongy – a guy would need cotton in his ears to keep from holding his 
breath too long.
I unloaded my gear and put it on the ice. Pulled the canoe onto the 
ice and loaded the gear back in. Wearing a life jacket and towing the 
canoe I headed across towards the knoll. A time or two I stopped and 
water began to pool around my feet. The ice was sagging. The farther 
I went the better the going. Hope Creek water was hard on the ice in 
front of my place. I trudged across with only a few soft spots. I slipped 
into the water on the far side and beached at the gravel spit. My bears 
were gone. Close to the top when I last saw them so now they would be 
on top.
September 5, 1971:
More writing to do and while I was about it Spike came down to 
wrap up the caribou and sheep skins to take along. While he was here I 
purchased his canoe, motor and all other gear that he has at Twin Lakes.
264 
	
Chapter 7
Dick purchased Spike’s gear but not the Carrithers’ two cabins. Spike sold 
the cabins to Bob Acheson.
September 7, 1971: 
Jack [a big game hunter from California] said, I have owned two 
canoes in my lifetime and have used them a lot – never turned one over 
and have been on rough water. It was good that he got baptized here and 
close to shore. A few hundred feet out and a wind against him it could 
have been tragic especially if he was alone at Twin Lakes.
September 19, 1971: 
A coat of Humicure for the wood handles of axes, shovel, hammer 
and another coat for the canoe paddles and the transom wood on the 
canoe. A coat to dress up my three-legged water bucket stand too.
September 19, 1972: 
The lake was good – I would go way down today. Some pictures 
I wanted at the head of the Chilikadrotna and maybe I could do the 
country a good deed. Make it look more as if man had never lived, after 
this hunting season.
 This had been one fine day. The little gas paddle got a free ride 
round trip. I had thought I would use it coming up but it was my last trip 
of the season from the lower end and I wanted to enjoy it to the utmost.
In writing “Make it look more as if man had never lived, after this hunt-
ing season” Dick was saying that he intended to clean the campsites of hunters. 
He removed the garbage and likely moved rocks from fire pits and those used 
Dick holding his L.L.Bean paddle.

The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
to hold the corners of tents to more natural locations. He likely removed spruce 
trees that hunters had mutilated badly with saws and axes.
May 28, 1974:
The ice is very rotten along the edge and there was a projecting point 
out into the open channel. I ran the bow of the canoe up onto it and 
broke it loose. I was pushing it away with my good L.L. Bean paddle. 
Crack! and I had paddles in both hands. Broke right in two above the 
lower grip. I was very lucky that I didn’t flip the canoe when it broke. 
Not far from shore but that water is so very cold. The paddle shaft was 
cross grain. The break only about four and one half inches long. That 
calls for a new $13.00 paddle. I mixed some epoxy and stuck it together. 
It might last a short while but I would want a spare. Lucky I have a new 
spare even though it isn’t near the paddle the L.L. Bean is or was.
June 17, 1974:
My canoe has been leaking a bit ever since the wind blew it in the 
lake and it ended up on the beach at the lower end. Full of water and 
gravel – the heavy surf had worked it and loosened some rivets. Not 
bad but I would see if I could find the leakers. On the sloping beach I 
rested the bow in land and set the stern on a gas can box. Shimmed it up 
level and bailed water into it until the water line and below was covered. 
With my felt tip marker I lay in the gravel and marked the leakers. I 
dumped the water, turned it bottom up and wiped it dry. I mixed up 
some epoxy and each offender got the business. Didn’t take much – with 
my forefinger I rubbed some on each one.
Dick’s epoxy-repaired rivets are still visible today and are still water tight.
September 16, 1974: 
… here came Babe in the old T craft.	
With my mail came that new $13.00 L.L. Bean canoe paddle. I had 
mentioned to him that I ordered it last June. “Why it has been setting 
in the post office all summer,” he said. It came with no name on it, just 
Port Alsworth. Mary [Alsworth] had written to L.L. Bean to find out 
who had ordered it. Really a beautiful paddle and lucky that my repaired 
one did last till now.
September 21, 1974: 
I left them to get squared away and came down to do some jobs 
I had been wanting to do. Cut my weak canoe paddle – shorten it six 
inches and make a new glued splice. The other splice had done well and 
I wondered how come it didn’t give way by this time. I had wrapped the 
splice with nylon tape and when I cut and peeled it off the paddle fell 
apart. A new splice cut and glued and wrapped tightly with nylon cord 
to hold it until it dries.
266 
	
Chapter 7
September 22, 1974:
I took the wrapping off of my repaired canoe paddle and sanded it 
smooth. Gave it a one course wrap of nylon tape and gave it and my new 
L.L. Bean paddle a coat of Flecto satin finish.
September 24, 1974: 
I would have an early supper and test my repaired canoe paddle. 
Only five feet now and a little short when kneeling but pretty nice when 
sitting on the seat.
November 25, 1974: 
Today I would make the switch from canoe to sled. The canoe a 
sorry sight, coated with ice from the last few times I used it. I put a tub 
of water on the stove to heat and also dug out Spike and Hope’s little 
Coleman gas stove. I fired it up and put it under the bottom up canoe. It 
wasn’t long until steam began to rise. The hot water poured end to end 
made short work of it and the stove kept it warm until it dried. I win-
terized the little kicker. Pulled the spark plug and gave it a good blast 
of WD-40. Wipe it clean from top to bottom and tucked it into one of 
Babe’s big paper feed sacks. The sled came out of Hope’s cabin and made 
its first run down along shore. Motor, gas tank, steering extension [long 
steering handle] and paddles went first trip and were tucked under the 
double bunk. The canoe next and it went willingly as if it welcomed a 
winters rest. The secret of getting it in the cabin and the door closed was 
well remembered and it soon rested comfortably inside. The second post 
hammered in place to carry the heavy snow load on the roof and I closed 
the door. I wonder what percentage of the canoes in use have seen as 
much use as that Elgin.
Dick is removing his sled from where it had been stored for the summer 
in the Carrithers’ “guest cabin” (Hope’s cabin). In its place he stored the motor, 
paddles etc. under the bunk beds in Hope’s cabin. He is putting the Elgin 
canoe into the Carrithers’ “main cabin” (Spike’s cabin), where it will stay for 
the winter. Only Spike’s cabin has the length needed for the canoe to fit inside.
To support the roof of Spike’s cabin from the weight of snow, Dick installed 
support poles under the ridge pole and purlins. I didn’t know Dick also put 
supports under these same roof logs in his cabin when he was leaving for the 
winter until I read his journals. These post have not been installed since Dick 
left to live with his brother but should be part of the closing of his cabin each 
fall since Dick’s roof timbers have now developed a downward bend. 
May 25, 1975: 
The ice a very dark blue and looked unsafe but it was good yesterday 
and would no more than squeak a bit today. Babe had said, drag the 
canoe – some day you will cross and it won’t carry you coming back.

The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
June 18, 1975:
Good news from Brother Jake. They had solved the problem of the 
oil thirsty Continental J-3 engine and he expected to get headed north 
by the end of the month. Three good letters from the Park Service. A 
pleasure to do business with those people. 
July 14, 1975: 
The cool of the past few days has brought a few caribou to the lower 
lake country. Near noon I spotted three cows and two calves, one calf 
very light in color. Where would the big herd be at this time. I had seen 
them in the Bonanza Hills earlier than this. Perhaps we can spot them 
when Jake gets here with the J-3. His last letter indicated that he might 
be here by mid July if everything clicked just right. Mid July is at hand 
and I don’t see any little yellow cub. Not easy to imagine that it may be 
resting its heels on my beach one of these days. Then starts the chore of 
keeping it out of trouble. 
August 1, 1975: 
A good breeze ruffled the lake and pitched more gravel on my 
beach. I pulled on my boots and with bare hands and rake I lengthened 
my usable beach towards Hope Creek. Now I have room for three air-
planes on my beach plus the good beach near Hope Creek.
August 10, 1975: 
A small plane flew up the far side. Another sheep spotter. Getting 
towards Glacier Creek when I noticed it was a cub and yellow. I could 
see the eyebrows over the cylinders so it was a J-3. It turned and came 
back down. Still I refused to get excited. I had about given up on seeing 
Jake fly in. It turned again and came in for a nice landing. As it passed 
slowing down I could see 7335H on the side and could see Jake in his 
easy chair rear seat. He had at last made it to the land of the future. That 
was the nicest thing that has happened at Twin Lakes for a long time. 
I told him that I had given up and expected that he had junked the 
remains and hitchhiked back to lower Calif. A late start was the reason. 
Couldn’t get away from L.A. until Aug. 1st. Nearly impossible to get a 
float plane into the water there. A delay in Seattle. With the fork lift, 
picking the cub out of the water for the night they had bent the spreader 
bars between the floats and had to get new ones air freighted out from 
New York State. Onward and upward and it got wetter as he went until 
it was just rain. A great experience for the first long float plane trip. We 
unloaded his gear and here came another cub. An old blue and yellow 
PA11 (after the cub). A heavy set stranger climbed out and introduced 
himself in a very broken English and I didn’t quite get it. As it turned 
out he was from Switzerland and had been over here for 12 yrs. at least.

sister from Switzerland over here on a visit and going back soon. They 
had read the book and wanted to see Twin Lakes country. I invited 
them in and they were good company. Great hikers and wanted to climb 
a mt. yet today but visited so long they didn’t get it done. Was there 
some place they could camp. I suggested the old campsite on the other 
side of Hope Creek. We walked over to see it and it suited perfectly. A 
nice up the lake breeze to keep the bugs away. 
When Dick and his brother Raymond made camp while flying their 
J-3 Cub, one item of gear they brought was the orange two-person tent Jerg 
Kroener left with Dick the previous year when he abandoned his effort to live 
in the wilderness like Dick.
August 23, 1975:
We wanted some camping footage. We … brought Jerg’s little 
orange tent … A nice little camp … . 
Time we headed for home and I asked Jake which way. You are 
doing the flying he said. I had made several take offs but only one land-
ing which was nothing to brag about. I had wished Will Troyer wasn’t 
standing on the beach watching. I climbed and turned left over the low 
summit leading to the big valley. Down and around the end and up the 
lakes. I set her down and got a well done from the master pilot. 
 Judging by journal entries and pictures, Jerg’s orange tent was Dick’s 
only lightweight tent. Dick hiked far from his cabin frequently traveling more 
than 20 miles in a day and occasionally more than 30 miles. He typically 
traveled light, carried minimal food, found water along the way but usually 
did carry either a 35mm camera or Bolex movie camera, or both, along with 
a telephoto lens. Sometimes he would stay in the cabin at the lower end of 
Lower Twin Lakes and do a long day hike from there. Several times he didn’t 
make it back to his cabin as night fell and stayed in the Vanderpool cabin at 
the lower end of Upper Twin Lakes. His orange tent was left in his cabin 
when he departed.
August 24, 1975:
I was stoved up. The Telaquana climb [Dick’s hike two days earlier] 
had did it – pulled some strings in my legs and my left ankle was hurt-
ing pretty good. We had planned to fly down to visit Terry & Vic [Gill] 
today but there would be five hours of hiking involved and it would 
seem like a long trail to me. We would stay home today.
I would soak my foot in some hot salt water. Jake would take a 
shower out under the meat tree. It seemed like a good idea and I was 
second in line. A second session of foot soaking while he went to Hope 
Creek with his spinning rod.
August 25, 1975:
The breakwater, we could add to it using my rock pile on the beach. 
 269
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
Use the canoe to ferry them to the location. A fair breeze and the surf 
not too gentle but we worked at it and soon made a good showing 
on both ends of the short haul. We had it (the breakwater) three feet 
beyond the tip of the floats and eight inches above water level when we 
called it good for now. The cub was resting easy in the lee of it. With 
hands and shovel we gouged out those half buried and moved them 
into shallow water for easy loading when the lake calmed. I can see a 
big improvement in the beach already and when we have completed the 
project it will be thirty feet longer.
No sound of Jerre and his little party returning and no smoke at 
his cabin… Many times he has said. I think about you here at the lakes 
alone. Paddling the canoe on rough water – no life jacket. Perhaps I 
have been lucky but I have a lot of confidence in my craft. Stay on the 
bottom, add a few stones for ballast. I may not hit the beach where I 
would like too but I will land on shore and won’t be wet when I do.
By noon the sun was breaking through and we decided some film-
ing was in order. Several sequences we could shoot if we had sunlight. 
Some rough water canoeing but I doubt that Jake would ride the bow 
and shoot towards the stern. Blueberry picking, spoon building, wood 
cutting – enough to keep us going for days. Sooner than we thought 
possible the weather said, “not today”.
Now at eight, the temp. 46°, the clouds look grey and angry. A light 
surf on my improved beach. The little ol’ cub resting easy in the lee of 
the break water of stones – Good to see it so.
Twenty years after Dick wrote, “I may not hit the beach where I would 
like to but I will land on shore and won’t be wet when I do,” my future wife 
K. Schubeck witnessed this first-hand.
K. met Dick Proenneke when she and Phil Caswell inventoried plants 
for Lake Clark National Park in the mid-1990s. They landed across Twin 
Lakes from Dick’s cabin. K. saw an old man canoeing toward their camp. 
She had not heard of Dick Proenneke, but Phil knew Dick and told her who 
she was about to meet. Dick invited them to his cabin for some tea. He canoed 
them the 11/2 miles across the lake to his cabin. Dick climbed the ladder to his 
cache to retrieve some special cookies to serve with tea. 
Dick suggested they hike to Tettering Rock, a half mile and 500 feet above 
his cabin, his “daily constitutional” during his last years. As they passed the 
woodshed where Dick kept his walking sticks he suggested K. use one and then 
upon returning said, “leave your walking stick for the next person.” 
The wind picked up as Dick paddled K. and Phil back across the lake. 
As the wind blew even harder K. watched Dick paddling home across a lake 
with rolling whitecaps. She felt terrible thinking this would be the end of Dick 
Proenneke. He was kneeling at mid-ship and did not try to paddle directly 
to his cabin but rather let the wind carry him to the beach more than a mile 
further down country where he stashed his canoe. He walked home and would 
later return to retrieve it.

the woodshed. (Photo by Monroe

Chapter 7
I wonder how many times Dick crossed a calm lake in the morning to 
return to his canoe in the evening and find the lake rough or wild. The wind 
blows with force for part of the day more often than not at Twin Lakes. Dick 
lived life much like the wildlife. He lived fully engaged moment to moment 
and at the same time on the edge of life. 
I once said to Alan Bennett, who knew Dick well, that Dick seemed to 
live in a place between “being an accident waiting to happen and someone 
with a honed sense for safety.” Alan said I could not have described Dick better.
In a 1990 interview with Theodore Karamanski Dick said, “… as far as 
being patient, the lake will teach you that. You’d better not be messing around 
out there if it’s too bad. I’ve been out there when it was so bad that I thought, 
boy now, it’s just touch and go. But you stay in the bottom, in a canoe – well, 
I think it’s pretty safe.
… you keep it low … You lay in the bottom, I think you could ride out 
most anything.
It’s just knowing there is a safe way and there is one with a little risk … 
Like in the mountains, if you’re away from the cabin and stuff like that. You 
know you don’t risk too much.”
August 26, 1975:
It was 12:30 last night when I was awakened by the sound of very 
strong wind and heavy surf. Rain was pecking against the big window. 
I lay there a minute and then it soaked in that we had a frail little kite 
parked half in and half out of the water. I had better take a check. I 
didn’t dress for packing boulders in the rain but I should have. I found 
the little bird not as we had left it. The tail pushed up country by the 
wind. That big boulder we were using for an anchor was moved out from 
the breakwater. Heavy surf was breaking over the floats. I came to the 
cabin and aroused Jake to tell him the news. We went out and surveyed 
the situation. She was beached as far as she would go but still rocking 
from the surf. The tail wanted to weathervane and if the wind got under 
that wing we could lose her. The big boulder wasn’t enough. In water it 
lost much of its weight. I went for a short length of pole that we tied a 
line around and then packed heavy rock to cover it. It was raining a real 
get wet rain as we trudged back and forth, using flashlights to locate 
good rocks. We built up the breakwater on the shore end a bit to keep 
a lot of gravel from spilling over. Still she was working on the bottom 
and Jake decided to fill the large mid section of the windward float with 
water. That did it and after watching it a few minutes we came inside. 
Jake turned in and I stayed up and read till 2:30 before checking again 
and calling it good.
Too much civilization. In pre cub days I wouldn’t have given the 
storm a second thought. Let it storm – nobody out but the hired man 
and the dog and the dog has sense enough to come in. About five it was 
Jake who woke me up. From his upper bunk he could see the near wing 
 271
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
moving up and down. That float would have to be watered down also. I 
started spuds for breakfast while he took care of the poor miserable little 
cub. Still the lake was wild but the wind had let up considerably.
My theory was – move her up until the water lost its force against 
her floats. We couldn’t slide her up the beach on bare gravel but we 
could build a slatted ramp. Build two – each a couple feet wide – join 
them at each end with a full-length slat to tie them together at the 
proper spacing. I went to work with the big Swede one man cross cut. 
Rip the poles down the center. Flat sides would be up for the float keels 
to slide on and flat sides down for the side rails and ties across top and 
bottom. It took some ripping and reminded me of the good old cabin 
building days when I ripped steady for a half day at a time. Saw dust 
piled up but we had many half round slats standing by. I dug under the 
bunks for nails and found enough. We nailed the slatted ramp sections 
together in the woodshed and then placed them behind the floats to nail 
the ties on. When she calmed we would pump the floats and try this 
good idea that might not work.
August 27, 1975:
Still a partial high overcast and I saw no frost but was sure that it 
did in the cold spots. The storm appeared over and it would be safe to 
bail the water ballast out of the floats on the cub. Jake went at it as soon 
J-3 Cub floatplane ramp.

as breakfast was over. I did the dishes to hasten the operation of getting 
operational again. Dishes done and floor leveled.
We had put the new ramp to use under the cub. I lifted the tail and 
Jake got the lower slat under the rear end of the keel. With me lifting 
and him pulling first one side and then the other she came back and up. 
It looked real good riding so high in the water. Now we would go look 
at the livestock. I took tripod and spotting scope. Jake the camera on the 
Bolex tripod. He would film me glassing the bear.
We hauled more rock until the surf got heavy. Enough for today. I 
started supper and Jake continued to gouge out rocks from my unlimited 
supply. The only way to stop him was yell chow down.
August 29, 1975:
With the lake calm, I would work on the breakwater. Use the canoe 
and pick the stones up country from where my rock pile used to be. 
A big fat parky squirrel has been around recently as if looking for his 
stone house. I hadn’t seen him this year till now. Load the canoe till 
only a few inches of free board and then paddle to the breakwater. I 
was building the outer end of it that is in fairly deep water. Some of the 
very heavy stones I could lift into the canoe but they were too heavy to 
lift out in the awkward position necessary for lifting. Those I moved to 
the near side listing the canoe until it took water and sank. I rolled it 
over dumping the stones and then lifted them into position. Back and 
forth beach to breakwater. It was shaping up slowly and looking good. It 
would be more than two feet higher than lake level and extend well out 
past the nose of the floats. Jake came out and asked if I was going to quit 
for lunch. 12:45 it was, and I was thinking it must be near noon. I had 
all of the heavy rock in place and the breakwater level end to end.
We had watched the weather. Better and worse and finally looking 
flyable maybe. It depended on what he found after he rounded the end 
of the Volcanic mountains. We dumped in 21⁄ 2 gal. of our remaining 
five so that he would have a reserve for safety. We launched the cub and 
he took off.
I would pack more rocks but use my mortar-packing tub. A breeze 
had come up the lake and a fair surf running. I wanted to beef up the 
down countryside of the stonework. Also around the end which would 
take a lot of rock because of deep water. All afternoon I packed tubs of 
coarse boulders and dropped them in place along the wall. Give that 
base a good foundation to stand up to the beating of a heavy surf. Tub 
after tub before I could see the rocks below the surface. Near water level 
I called it good and then packed more fine stuff to fill in between the 
rocks. The weather held about the same. It was getting late but I didn’t 
feel it was seven o’clock that I learned on coming for a check. It would 
be dark soon. Jake had better hurry or stay at Babe’s for the night and no 
telling how much longer.
 273
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
August 30, 1975:
The weather faired up a bit although it still looked sour down coun-
try. I went to the woodshed for my rock-packing tub and found Jake 
exercising the big Swede saw. I had seen where I could do more good 
on the breakwater with a few dozen tubs of rocks and fine stuff. Build 
a good base around that pile of rocks and perhaps it would stand a real 
heavy surf. How about the drifting ice in June. Ice drifting up would hit 
the point of Hope Creek flat first, I hope. The breakwater should also be 
good for getting onto the ice when the water shows along the edge.
Jake had found my good gas can cache at the end of the woodshed. 
No need to be hauling a lot of extra fuel around – he would drain some 
and cache it with six cans he had ferried back from Babe’s. In tanks and 
cans he had brought back 65 gal. which adds up in dollars and cents at 
$1.40 per gal.
September 1, 1975:
Jake went to work tinkering with his favorite toy, the cub and I did 
more house cleaning and I wrote a letter.
September 10, 1975:
The wind was very strong during the night. Gusts and strong ones 
in the spruce tops. Rain rattled on the chimney guard. I thought of the 
little ol’ cub sitting there really anchored down on the down country 
side. I had said, “there is no danger from a down the lake wind. The 
timber is good protection.” Then I remembered the time the canoe 
rolled, broke its line and I walked to the lower end to find it full of sand, 
gravel and water. A freak gust might get under that up country wing and 
flip that little frail thing on its back. Still there and resting easy when 
daylight came. The storm was not over by quite a bit, but it had taken 
much snow from the mts. 
October 8, 1975: 
He introduced himself as Insurance Adjuster for Northern 
Insurance Adjustors. John C. Smith, his name. The manager himself.  
He had to inspect the cub. He hadn’t seen a J-3 as nice as that in 20 
years. He allowed it would be worth as much on the market as a super 
cub ($17,000.00). Bring it to Anchorage and someone will take it away 
from you, he said.
October 12, 1975:
Out over Lake Clark and the journey was about over. The breeze 
was from the pass so I would fly down along shore and make my landing 
approach over the airstrip towards Babe’s Bay. As we taxied back to the 
beach Babe was busy getting the three-wheel float plane dolly down to 
the waters edge. As we climbed out he said, “I guess you want to take 
the floats off right away.” To me it was as if he was jealous of my heaven 
274 
	
Chapter 7
and would eliminate any chance of me getting back to it anymore this 
year. From April 29th of 1974 to Oct. 12, 1975 I had been there. In 
many ways it was the best year and a half (nearly) I have ever spent there 
but in other ways it had been the worst. Too many people had died 
because I was there. Because I was there I am truly sorry. The End.
Dick was leaving Twin Lakes for the winter. The “worst” refers to 
the Ketchum Air’s Dehavilland Beaver that had crashed and killed seven 
National Park Service employees and the pilot. In the fall of 1975 Dick was 
filming for the National Park Service. The park employees who were working 
on the expansion of national parks in Alaska stopped off to see Dick not real-
izing that Dick and Raymond were out flying the J-3 Cub. The Beaver was 
returning to Lake Clark when it crashed. 
Dick returned in the spring of 1976 flying the J-3 Cub from Iowa to Twin 
Lakes. His journaling began in 1976 with the undated paragraphs below: 
The Flight of the ‘Arctic Tern’
1976 had the potential of being the greatest adventure of them all. I 
had learned to fly way back in 1948, earned my private pilots license at 
Lexington, Oregon while working on the Wilkinson ranch on Willow 
Creek above Heppner. In 1950 I went to Alaska and to the island of 
Kodiak. Busy working and little opportunity to fly there. My flying 
activity (except as passenger or co pilot) except for being checked out in 
a Cessna 150 and shooting a few landings with a Cessna 175 was hardly 
worth mentioning.
While building my cabin here at Twin Lakes in 1968 Babe flew in 
with his little old Taylor craft. That’s what I needed – a little airplane 
parked out front. I wrote to my brother Ray in Calif. and asked him 
to look for a cub. After a big search he found a Piper J-3 with 85 hp. 
engine. It needed much work done to make it satisfactory so he took it 
apart and built it back like new from the ground up. A nicer than new 
J-3 when he called it good in the summer of 1975. He located and pur-
chased a set of 1400 Edo floats, installed them and flew it up the west 
coast to Anchorage and Twin Lakes. From Aug. 10 when he arrived to 
Oct. 12 when we closed up my camp and flew out, it had been one big 
adventure. I was filming for the National Park Service and we used it to 
cover the proposed park area.
May 8, 1976:
It was five before I realized and I hurried to get going. Clear and a 
down lake breeze during the day but I figured it would calm towards 
evening. The cub light and it climbed like a home sick angel. A little 
turbulent but smooth over Lake Clark …
Babe had butchered a goat (kid). I could use some good 80-87 gas 
and put ten in the left wing and two cans in a gas-can box which just fits 
perfect on my cargo platform. The 35-pound package resting just behind 
 275
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
them. A real nice arrangement for load. “Better stay and have a bowl of 
soup and some crab salad”, Mary said and I didn’t wait for her to change 
her mind. Babe cut off a chunk of goat meat. I collected my few letters 
and was ready to fly. The sun getting low in the west. A smooth trip in 
and I landed in the big shadow of Falls mountain using my long string 
of spruce tips as a guide on landing. I find a big expanse of pure white 
something like glassy water. A little bit difficult to judge height. The day 
was done by the time I got everything squared away.
Knowing the lake ice softens and melts sooner along the shore, Dick parked 
his plane offshore where the ice stays solid much longer.
May 9, 1976:
What could I do to insure the safety of the cub as the ice decreases 
in thickness and strength. More area on the ice would do it. I dragged 
out our beaching rack used last summer when the cub was on floats. 
A 2" x 6" to cover the slots and make a runway for the main wheels on 
each side. Some good triangular chocks to block the wheels. I needed 
something heavier for wing tied downs too. For this I used my two 
slatted cabin window covers to lie on the ice. A burlap sack holding 
three heavy stones to lay on the cover on one side and a G.I. duffle bag 
with three big stones on the other. A good line around cover and bagged 
stones. Plenty heavy for a good blow. A 2" x 6" for the tail wheel to rest 
on. It looked pretty good. Now I’m hoping that this ice holds good until 
Babe’s bay is open for floats. While I was at it I wiped the Anchorage 
dust from the top surfaces, pulled the cowl for a look inside and wipe 
away any oil seepage I might find.
I had my camera gear to get ready. Film bands and boxes to address. 
More digging in the cache for items I needed. My 30-06 came out of 
hiding and appears to be in perfect condition.

Chapter 7
May 12, 1976:
I had been thinking of another improvement to insure the safety of 
the cub. I had a long (20 foot) pole, well seasoned and strong. I would 
lay it across the float beaching rock just behind the landing gear. Lash 
it to the cross bars of the rack. A wide four foot length of plank under 
each end to help carry the load in case the rack and cub should decide to 
settle straight down into possibly 50 feet of water. I feel it would be per-
fectly safe with nothing under the wheels for at least a week from now. 
To be doubly safe is very important now and in the future.
I continued on – just as well go all the way to the [connecting] stream. 
When I leave the ice here to come back on floats I may have to land and 
beach at the upper end of the lower lake. Good to have a location in 
mind. The [connecting] stream low but rising. Hardly more than ankle 
deep at the fording place. Less than a hundred yards below Herb Wright’s 
sheep camp a perfect place to come ashore. Deep water close to the beach. 
A fair beach by moving a few boulders. A couple sturdy spruce trees on 
the high bank 30 feet from the water. With my little half-ton hoist and a 
few lengths of poles from the old sheep camp I could have her high and 
dry in short order. In a little bite of the beach good protection from wind 
up or down. Also protection from the wind pushed ice if it came up from 
down country. A half-mile of open water now – a good place to land.
Dick is planning ahead to put his plane on floats and move it to a more secure 
place with open water. As the lake ice became unsafe to leave his plane parked on 
wheels in front of his cabin, this site where the connecting stream flows into the 
lower lake (below Herb Wright’s sheep camp) is the first place on Twin Lakes to 
have open water to land a float plane in spring. Parking his plane where he could 
land on the first ice-free water would mean he would have to hike the 31/2 miles 
from his plane back to his cabin. Dick made this 7-mile round trip several times, 
once pushing his sled across the frozen lake as far as the connecting stream and the 
other times following the shoreline and game trails as hikers do today.
May 13, 1976:
Last evening before turning in I set my time back to Wilderness 
standard time. I like to see the sun in its proper place morning, noon 
and evening – so – this morning I got up at 4:30.
May 16, 1976:
This afternoon I would take time out to move the cub about 20 feet 
farther out. An old crack in the ice had passed through under it and later 
when the lake rises that crack is sure to open up. Wheels on one side 
and tail on the other – no good. On moving it I discovered that the ice 
under it was hard and very much better than the ice not covered by the 
float rack. It and the plane had kept the sun from working on the ice. 
So – now I would make a special effort to cover it better. Cut up a few 
cardboard boxes to cover the open areas of the rack and the ice along 
 277
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
side. A parking area covered with a couple inches of sawdust would be 
good I think. Now I think the cub is safe until time to leave the ice and 
go to floats. Out on the open ice it is exposed to an up the lake wind but 
still partially protected from one blowing down.
May 19, 1976:
On the way over I had wondered about Babe’s Bay. I doubted that it 
was open for floats. If it was I just might put the floats on and quit mess-
ing with the ice that is getting weaker by the day. Except for one little 
nick of ice to shore in front of Terry and Vic’s cabin [Terry and Vic Gill] 
there was room enough to take off. Babe allowed that it is best not to 
gamble with the ice too long. It comes a time when you think it is time 
to get off and maybe a real storm comes and pins you down so you can’t 
move. We would put the floats on tomorrow.
Terry and Vic Gill had a cabin at Port Alsworth in addition to their 
cabin at their gold mining claim in the Bonanza Hills.
May 20, 1976: 
It was calm and the weather promised to improve. Before we pulled 
the wheels off we would fly to Nondalton and visit the mission girls. 
Doris [Hagedorn] had her mother at the mission for a short visit and then 
she would return home to Wycolt, Wash. I had told them one time that 
I would like to meet her. She is in failing health and this will no doubt 
be her last trip north. I flew and Babe road the back seat. A nice smooth 
flight up. I really wanted to do a good job with the old master along but 
my landing wasn’t the best. He allowed I was landing too fast for that 
uneven runway.
Having flown back to Port Alsworth, Babe’s son, Glen Alsworth, helped 
Dick exchange the J-3’s tires for floats.
Glen and I backed the J-3 in again and proceeded to put the floats on. 
Everything fit and by suppertime she sat ready and waiting to be towed 
out of the hanger and dumped in the bay.
May 21, 1976:
I was ready to go to Twin Lakes but figured I would stay if they had 
some thing we could make some real progress at. Babe had one lined up. 
Clean out the chicken house and put it on the garden (other than where 
we planted spuds). One year since the chicken house was cleaned out… 
A job well done before noon.
Glen was feeling ambitious and suggested we clean up some of the 
trash lying about… Four big loads of trash, we hauled and the place 
looked much better. The weather holding fair and I would go tomor-
row. But before tomorrow I would patch the house roof and clean the 
chimney.

Chapter 7
May 22, 1976:
I was ready to go. Mary [Alsworth] had my list made up and as soon 
as we dumped the cub in the water I could be on my way. Only one 
drawback. During the night that big ice floe had moved tight against 
Terry’s beach. My escape route was cut off. Dead calm so the ice would 
stay put. We launched the cub and then surveyed the situation. Took 
the boat and eased into the floe. Sat there and churned for ten minutes 
and it didn’t appear to move. We ran the open water around to Pike 
Bay. A good long stretch but I would have tall trees to clear on the far 
end or turn before I reached them. For the first take off on floats (of the 
season) I preferred straight out the channel. We went back and beached 
the boat. I suggested we take another look at the ice against the beach. 
It had moved away two feet and was moving. I took a long board and 
put my weight against it. Moving very slowly but I could feel it going. 
We waited and I went up to pay Mary for my grub. I don’t have it 
figured up yet – let it go until next time. When would they see me 
again. I had received a letter from Jay Hammond – said he would be on 
Lake Clark for a couple days starting May 29. He wanted to talk about 
building. If the weather was favorable I would come back to Lake Clark 
the 29th.
By now the ice had given me lots of room. I warmed her up. This 
was it – the first flight on floats in 76. A fair load in the back seat so I 
rode the front. The little cub acted eager to fly and got right off. Open 
water in Lake Clark as near as Tom’s island [Tommy Island] now and 
much of the rest of the lake showing much broken ice and open water. I 
headed for Miller lake cabin and as I climbed saw clouds to the north. 
Weather was building up. Mild turbulence after I crossed the Kijik. 
I climbed to 4,100 and over the high bench land before Chili River 
country. Around the bend and the lower lake looked about as it did 
when I left on the 19th. Duck lake showed no breeze direction and I 
was letting down shooting for that nice long and wide stretch of open 
water below the connecting stream. Lower and lower. I was ten feet up 
as I passed the edge of the ice. Nose up a bit as she settled and I was on 
the water. A real nice landing I thought. I put in at my beaching spot 
and now how would it go. I would have to pull her out bow first and up 
a pretty steep incline. I was soon rigged up. Poles for the float keels to 
slide on. A strong spruce to act as dead man. She came easy enough but 
bow high – too high and I lowered the line to the base of the tree. Still 
stern heavy and I wondered how I would get this monster back into 
the water. No place to pull from on that end. I would figure out some-
thing and pulled her in close to the bank. For tie downs, a pole each 
for wings and tail. The poles buried under a rock pile. I had taken off at 
nine now at 11:45 I was ready to head up the lake packing some perish-
ables in a packsack Glen had loaned me.
 279
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
May 23, 1976:
This was a cool morning. I had slept real sound and hated to stir, 
so I rested till five. Hotcakes, bacon, and oatmeal for breakfast. This 
morning would be a working day. I would get my sled out of Hope’s 
cabin and haul a load of cub launching gear down and bring my grocer-
ies back. My 2 x 6’s I would take to slide the cub on. Babe’s heavy patent 
anchor to pitch into deep water and hope that it would hold enough to 
allow winching the cub back to water. A pole flattened on each end to 
go under the tails of the floats. A sawhorse type stand to run my pulling 
line over to get some lift on the stern. A bridle from the rear float fit-
tings at the floats back and under the pole to get a lift when pulling over 
the stand. It would work if the anchor would hold. Everything ready 
and loaded. I had glassed the far side and was surprised to see a new 
lamb on Allen mountain A few days old I was sure, for the mother was 
on the move. The sun was warm and the ice good for sledding. I traveled 
right along and soon stopped to shed my down vest. 
Two loads packed my gear past the connecting stream to the cub. 
A skid way leveled and my planks in place. The pole lashed crosswise 
under the stern. I was ready to start but not until the 29th.
Such weather makes me feel that the “Arctic Tern”, in its move from 
the ice to the beach was a smart move. A three and a half mile hike to 
check on it is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that goes with 
knowing it is safe from drowning.
Dick hiked back to his plane, pushing a load of gear on his sled each way 
across the frozen surface of the upper lake.
May 24, 1976: 
The snow had left my beach so I picked up the coarse rock and put 
them on the breakwater. Where the Arctic Tern will be parked I raked 
it smooth. The lake level up 4 inches since I came May 7.
This afternoon I would search for a good long straight pole to 
help in launching the cub. The best place to find good poles is below 
Jerre’s cabin a half mile. With sled and axe I headed across. The sled 
good in more ways than one. A great help in case I ran onto some 
weak ice and also a bridge to get from ice to shore on the far side. On 
the way across I saw 14 head of ewes and yearlings on Allen moun-
tain. I traveled the beach from near Falls Creek to the pole patch and 
cut a good one. A bit heavy but by the time I peeled it and dressed it 
down it would be good.
With the drawknife I peeled the pole and removed a half inch of 
the diameter at the big end. Just about right for weight and I expect it 
will be the answer to my launching problems. I would tie a line around 
each float just behind the step. Tie them loose to allow the pole to slip 
through. Poke the big end through and across, resting the big end on 
a protected area of the other float. Lots of leverage to lift one side and 
280 
	
Chapter 7
inch it back. Then pull the pole and move it to the other side and repeat 
the procedure. Slow but sure, I hope.
May 25, 1976:
I had a few things to do to the cub. Install the new rudder horn 
extension that Jake had sent. Replace a few not so good cotter pins with 
new ones. Replace a few loose sheet metal screws with larger ones. A 
few spots to touch up with cub yellow. And that about did it except for 
covering the engine cowl with my green tarp.
Dick hiked along the beach to work on his plane and then hiked home.
May 27, 1976:
I needed a case of some sort to carry my tools (small hand tools for 
the airplane) in. I searched my ten years gathering and came up with a 
six-inch length of rain tite pants leg. Brand new. I also had some sal-
vaged zippers. I would make an oversize tobacco pouch type case. Seal 
one end and zipper in the other. A real good-looking rig and I would 
guarantee it to last for the duration.
This little tool case, moved from Dick’s cabin to the archives in 2000, was 
one of the dozens of Dick Proenneke’s handcraft I identified once I was given 
access to his journals in 2017. Reading the journals allowed me to identify 
many of Dick’s handcrafted items and to tell a story for each possession.
May 29, 1976:
This was going to be a chore I could see that. I put a line on Babe’s 
heavy anchor and pitched it over the side into deep water down the slope 
of the sharp drop off. I pulled and it held pretty well. I tied a bridle 
pulling from the base of the rear struts and under the ends of the rear 
spreader bar. The V of the bridle back and under a pole tied under the 
heels of the floats. I used my 3-foot high stand to support the anchor 
line and get some lift on the tails of the floats. I hooked the little 1⁄ 2-
ton lever hoist in between. I tightened it up and saw the anchor alone 
wouldn’t pull the load so I took a good strain and then got on the pole 
tied across. It moved an inch or so and then to the other side for a heave 
ho. Tighten the line and repeat the process. The water was calming. No 
more than ten feet to go but it took a couple hours before the tails of the 
floats were in the water. Now it was manpower alone for the hoist had 
to quit because of deep water. At last she was floating free and I turned 
her, tail to the beach. A puff of wind and it died. I warmed her up and 
donned my life jacket. Off and flying.
Across to Babe’s Bay and there were chunks of ice scattered in the 
landing area. The breeze was down the lake and into his Bay so I would 
approach from his airstrip and land beyond the point near Woodward’s 
cabin. The water glassy there and I smacked the water a bit.

The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
Babe met me at the beach with a slab for under the float tails.
Babe said “would you care to join me with a dish of ice cream and 
then we will go down and look at Bee’s T craft.” [Wayne “Bee” Alsworth 
was a son of Babe and Mary Alsworth.]
A good trip and a gentle breeze up the lower lake. A turn over the 
lower end of the upper lake and I set her down real easy. Now how would 
the beaching go? Tail first this time. The pole under the float tails. The 
stand to pull over up and back. My two by sixes to slide on. It went much 
better than going into the water but even then it was after nine o’clock 
before I had her all secure for leaving. It would be 11 o’clock before I 
walked up the path to my cabin. My float beaching rack – from up here 
[Dick’s beach] would make beaching a cinch there [below Herb Wright’s 
sheep camp] but hardly worth the effort to take it down for an operation or 
two. I could cut some poles and build one there in a short time.
June 6, 1976:
This would be a good morning to go down and get the cub. If the 
breeze shifted the ice would be in against the beach in a half hr. No time 
like the present and I was soon eating my fried spuds bacon and egg. It 
was 4:10 when I walked the log bridge across Hope Creek. As I traveled 
the beach I watched the overcast down country. If clouds started forming 
on my side of the peaks wind was on the way. The mountains a pretty 
sight for new snow capped them all the way to the lower end. One hr. 
to the gravel banks and I wondered if the foxes had returned from their 
nights hunt. I changed from shoe pacs to hip boots where the stream 
dumps into the lower lake. There must have been two miles of open 
water from the stream down. One hour and twenty minutes going down.
The cub in good shape and how difficult would she be to launch. 
Not too bad, a good heave ho first on the tail of one float and then the 
other inches her forward and down. Still dead calm I was going to make 
it – no problem. At last she floated free. I needed my 2 x 6’s and more 
gear so lashed it against the float struts on each side and was ready to 
warm up. While warming the engine I taxied down and then made a 
turn about and was off in good shape before I reached the stream. The 
upper lake that dark blue color with thousands of cracks showing. Here 
and there a little patch of open water. I followed the Low Pass side and 
finally made out the open water that would be my landing area. It didn’t 
look so purty big now but I knew there was lots of room. Only a few feet 
above the edge of the ice when I came to the glassy pond. She touched, 
I was home in good shape. In to my beach and the breakwater. Still the 
lake level is low so I would skid her completely out of the water and well 
past the tip of the breakwater in case the ice moved up. Seven o’clock I 
was here and 8:30 she was high and dry and everything secure.
What a relief it must have been to finally have his plane secure at home 
behind the breakwater on his own beach.

June 9, 1976:
This afternoon a project in mind. The left tail section of the cub 
floats collected water and I wondered if there was something I could do 
to correct it. I removed the cover and filled it with water. Not a trace of a 
leak. I suspected it might be the cover, not fitting close enough. I found 
it not sealing all the way around and traded it for one farther forward 
which are well out of the water at any time.
Another improvement would be some way to get the step of the 
floats started onto the beaching rack without being so far out in deep 
water. I came up with a couple of wedges about two and one half feet 
long spaced and held together by a length of pole spiked to the back. 
The wedges less than a half inch thick on the front edge and two inches 
thick on the rear where the pole is spiked. Thusly 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
and 
With the steps touching gravel put the wedges in place just behind. 
A slight lift up and back to get the steps started up the incline. Put the 
rack behind the wedges and the steps go from the wedge to the rack no 
problem – we shall see, first beaching.
June 22, 1976: 
An hour and it let up and I made for the beach through the wet 
brush. The canoe, what was a little rain – dump it out and go. In the 
canoe my knee protectors. Both of rubber – one doesn’t absorb water 
but the other like a sponge. I would have cold knees when I reached my 
beach.
Wedge improvement for J-3 Cub ramp.

The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
June 23, 1976:
I sawed and split a length of wood, raked my beach and packed 
many tubs of coarse gravel to the down country side of the break water. 
The beaching rack I would improve. Double the no. of slats to prevent 
the end of the keel from hooking as I pulled the floats up the incline. 
A second slat full length at the outer end to make a platform to hold 
a heavy stone. Heavy enough to sink the forward end to the bottom. As 
I ripped poles for the project it began to rain lightly and as I nailed them 
on it had increased to a blueberry growing rain. 
July 9, 1976:
A few tinkering jobs to do on the Cub to make it ready for inspec-
tion. My log books to bring up to date. I learned that I have flown about 
100 hrs. solo since last Oct. and am now a 150 hr. pilot. The cub has 
flown nearly 230 hrs. since last July.
August 9, 1976:
Now that little jewel of a kicker. I hung it on the canoe and gave 
it a trial run past Hope Creek and back. As it did yesterday, skipped, 
missed and died when running slow. Then it refused to start and I was 
very fortunate to have the good L.L. Bean paddle along. On the beach 
I pulled the spark plug. It looked good but sometimes looks don’t count. 
I dug out a new one that Spike had sent years ago. It installed and she 
fired right off and idled right down to nothing. I switched back to the 
old one. Same as before and it has made its last canoe trip with me. How 
lucky can one be. Had it quit cold at the lower end after I left the beach 
I would have ended up on the beach all the way down. A long walk 
home and back for it when the lake calmed. I mixed more gas and feel 
confident that when the time comes to battle the rough lake again, the 
little kicker will do its part.
August 23, 1976: 
Breakfast over and I prepared for a trip way down to capture the 
swans if they were still there. The way to go would be with the cub for I 
could spot them wherever they were in the immediate area, but I would 
canoe and take a chance. Take the little kicker along for the ride going 
and use it coming back for I wanted to haul a 55-gallon drum from 
Skywagon point. [A drum Dick and Jake used to salvage a crashed Cessna 
Skywagon the year before.]
September 20, 1976:
It was one year ago today that Jake and I flew to Port Alsworth and 
learned of the Beaver crashing and eight losing their lives. On the way 
back we came onto the Ketchum Skywagon bottom up in the lower lake. 
A beautiful day weather wise, but give me the snow, peace and quiet of 
Twin Lakes instead.

Chapter 7
Dick was deeply affected by the loss of those who came to visit him. The 
very day he finds out about that accident, on his return flight home, he and 
his brother spotted yet another plane crashed in the waters of Twin Lakes. 
Fortunately there was no loss of life in this second crash. Dick and Raymond 
later spent three days flipping that plane over before it was helicoptered from 
Twin Lakes.
A few years later Dick salvaged the engine from another floatplane that 
sank in Lower Twin Lakes. Dick met the challenges and winter conditions of 
this late September and October salvage project with enthusiasm. Dick used 
his J-3 Cub, the Elgin and a raft made of 55-gallon drums, 2 x 6s and a 
come-a-long to salvage both airplanes. (The stories are, however, too lengthly 
to be included here.)
September 26, 1976:
My platform in place over the nose cowl. A can resting on it until 
I got in position to lift it to the funnel. I was wearing my Canadian 
Sorels, big and clumsy. I hoisted the can and had it running into the 
funnel when my left foot slipped from the exhaust stack and down I 
went into the water between the floats. On my back and the spare part 
can of gas in the water with me. I floundered around to get up and had 
a time of it. Gas was pouring off of the trailing edge of the wing. That 
can of gas was laying on the wing and draining as fast as it could. I got 
to it from the left float reaching up over the wing. Boy oh boy! What a 
revolting development. About now I began to hurt. My right arm hurt 
as if it was badly bent if not broken. My ribs high up on the right side 
hurt … Soaking wet, pacs full of water. The part can of gas that was on 
the bow of the float badly bent and it could only be from me falling on 
it as I went down. I was hurting pretty good but I completed the job. 
What a way to start the last days before doing a lot of filming. Getting 
in and out of the cub would be a chore. The can that tipped from the 
funnel onto the wing had made a couple dents in the fabric and scuffed 
a little paint off over a rib. Pretty lucky not to have done more damage 
to the cub and myself. A second change of clothes today and everything 
taken care of with no small amount of discomfort.
September 27, 1976:
I slept well last night and this morning a sore spot on my ribs but 
my arm not too bad. After hotcakes I heated more water for more hot 
packs and was feeling pretty good.
September 28, 1976:
Today I would continue with my chore of closing up. The canoe 
and paddles to Spike’s cabin and it seemed sorta good to see the canoe 
bottom up in the dry. The bar in place behind the door and the same at 
Hope’s cabin as I passed. Last winter it had been opened and the upside 
down gas lantern used and returned to its nail on the rear wall.
 285
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
Now where to hide my valuables. The tripods I wrapped in plastic 
and tucked them back against the wall below the lower bunk. The Bolex 
I packed good and put it in the bottom of my rice sack in the cache. The 
two long lenses went into the bean sack and the pan head in a gallon can 
and covered with a plastic bag of dried, sliced potatoes. Very convincing 
if they don’t lift the cans. Things so well hidden I may have a problem of 
finding them myself. The big pistol (in plastic) and stuck in the far end 
of a roll of sleeping bag ground protection insulation.
September 29, 1976:
At last the window covers went on and I closed the door. Again 
my note had been tacked on. It read, “My cabin is closed for the winter, 
Thanks! if you leave it that way”. It could be taken two ways. Thanks 
if you leave it closed or close it when you leave. Those wanting to stay 
awhile would choose the later meaning.
I raked the beach one last time and with that, the operation got 
my stamp of approval. A light load for the cub. It would be a no strain 
trip. Away from the beach and I taxied towards Farmer’s cabin. I turned 
circles in the bite of the beach past Hope Creek while waiting for the 
oil temperature to rise. Then down around the Farmer knoll for the take 
off run towards the point. A little turbulence out of Hope Creek flat as 
I passed and I was in the air as I passed that famous little cabin. A turn 
up lake around Carrither’s point and climbing at a good rate. A turn 
across and down. I was on my way.
September 30, 1976:
We loaded the cub on the dolly and towed it to that hanger with 
the new concrete floor. What a pleasure after the dirt floor and great 
accumulation of junk crowding in on all sides. Babe stayed until we got 
the floats off and the landing gear hung in place and then went on about 
his business.
October 4, 1976: 
Overcast, Rainy, & Warm.
Waiting for weather and it wasn’t cooperating.
Waiting for weather is a metaphor for living in ‘bush’ Alaska.
October 6, 1976:
It was near ten o’clock when we untied the cub and started the 
engine. While we stood and talked the engine slowed and I pulled 
carburetor heat. It ran rough for a few seconds and then smooth again. 
Carburetor ice, this was a good day for it.
Now I passed Sheep Mt. Lodge and its airstrip that appeared to 
be fair. A family lived below the highway and under me but I knew of 
no airstrip there. I pulled the heat on again and after several seconds 
I pushed it off. No indication of ice. Probably it was a couple minutes 
286 
	
Chapter 7
later when sudden silence took over. The engine had quit as if the switch 
had been turned off. Again I pulled the carburetor heat on and flipped 
the switch to off and back to both magnetos again. Nothing, I tried 
the primer and got no response. I worked the throttle that would do no 
good unless it was ice on the throttle plate that was causing the stop-
page. By now I was in deep trouble. The river fork lay down to my right 
but it would put me a long way from the highway and I doubted that a 
safe landing could be made there. To my left was up grade and I would 
be on the ground sooner with less time to pick a landing spot. Getting 
low, a landing was about to take place. I remember being perhaps two 
or three times the height of the spruce timber and descending at a good 
rate. Too fast I knew but I couldn’t dive to gain speed and flatten my 
glide. I suspect that I pulled the stick back to slow as much as I dared if 
I wasn’t already stalled out. Then, no more until suddenly I was standing 
forward of the right wing and facing the cub. At first glance I took it 
to be totaled out. It had struck on the nose and landing gear. The gear 
folded tight against the fuselage. The under side of the nose cowling 
smashed and one blade of the propeller bent back. The wing tips had 
come forward and down to the ground. The left wings rear fitting had 
pulled loose from the fuselage. The tail undamaged and three or four 
feet in the air. Wrinkled fabric everywhere from the rear of the baggage 
compartment forward. A real sad looking cub.
Now, how about me. My face felt numb and was dripping blood. 
The instrument panel had a deep imprint of my face in it. No wonder 
I was feeling not quite right about my head. My back hurt and when I 
moved to pick up the sleeping bag muscle spasms hit me hard. There was 
an urge to just unroll that bag, crawl in and rest awhile.
I could hear traffic on the highway and could see cars and trucks 
going by. I decided that I had better go while I was able. I headed for 
the road after one last look at the Arctic Tern. This, I figured was the 
end of the last flight of the “Arctic Tern”.
Going was slow and painful. Twice I rested during the 200 yards 
to the highway. I came to the steep gravel grade and decided I couldn’t 
climb it on foot so I crawled up to the shoulder. I was still on hands and 
knees when a camper came by, headed for Eureka and Glennallen. It 
passed and then slowed, stopped and backed up. A middle aged man 
and woman got out and decided I was in trouble and had better get to a 
doctor. They loaded me in the seat with them and as we started to leave 
I looked and could see the yellow tail of the cub over the brush. What a 
way to end the enjoyable year of 1976.
Dick spent months recuperating from a back injury before returning to 
Twin Lakes the following summer. Raymond Proenneke shipped the parts of 
the J-3 Cub to his home in Hemet, California, where he rebuilt it. In 1992, 
Raymond flew the “Arctic Tern” back to Alaska and back to Twin Lakes before 
selling the plane in Anchorage.  
 287
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
July 14, 1977: 
What to do about my kicker steering handle? I had reworked my 
long steering handle to be used with out the original handle with grip. I 
could shorten the handle one inch (the length of the end that broke off) 
and shape a new end. A simple task but I didn’t have the proper tools. 
A small hacksaw, a half-inch wood chisel, wood rasps and file. It was 
aluminum so every thing I had would cut. The end shaped thusly  
 
was soon formed to fit into the  
fork on the end of part  
bolted to the motor shaped thusly 
A hole drilled to take the screw and the job was done and guaran-
teed. By removing the grip I could still use my reworked steering handle 
for steering from mid-ship.
October 25, 1977: 
Partly cloudy, Lt. Breeze dn. & 14 degrees.
It looked like the perfect day I wanted to make the long journey all 
the way down to the head waters of the Chilly river and a mile beyond. 
A wonderful scene from the bend of the river and I had shot it in sum-
mer and fall but never with snow in the immediate area. I wanted to 
be there at 12 noon when the sun would be due south. I needed a blue 
sky and some white clouds would be desirable. I rushed around to get 
breakfast and dishes done, gear packed and loaded. It would take three 
and one half hours steady going to get there by paddle power. The kicker 
would go along to help me home in case the wind acted up. It was past 
nine when I shoved out so I would have to push it a bit.
A beautiful day as I beached.
Did it, and I was happy for the day. Then it happened – the light 
went out and the wind came very strong down the river. Clouds of snow 
rushed down the river flat and snow from the trees filled the air. Boy oh 
boy! Now I was behind the eight ball. If it continued to blow I had no 
chance of canoeing home motor or no motor … I would head back. If I 
had to hike the eight miles I had no time to mess around.
At the lake a heavy surf rolling into shallow water and as far as 
I could see white caps. A million of them. Maybe after the front had 
passed it would settle down but I couldn’t waste time on that possibility.
I had beached at the extreme end of the lake and exposed to the 
full force of the gale. No chance to launch there. My favorite beaching 
spot was blocked by new ice a hundred yds from shore. I had paddled 
through a hundred feet of scum ice getting to the beach.
288 
	
Chapter 7
A border of ice at waters edge and I could skid the canoe around 
the shoreline to a semi-protected spot. There I could get out and the 
kicker going if I was brave and foolish enough to try. I moved the 
canoe and packed everything else. The wind so strong it would blow 
the canoe away if I didn’t park it on bare rocks. If I could beat my way 
to wind ward for a half mile up along shore I could run with it on a 
stern quarter and make it to the other side into Lake Trout Bay. I could 
cache the canoe and motor in the spruce clump at Skywagon point and 
hike it up the lakes and home. I would give it a try. Everything loaded 
and the stern of the canoe on the shore ice with the tail end hanging 
over. I started the kicker and warmed it up. There would be no time 
for messing around once I left the beach. In no time I would be in the 
shallow water heavy surf. In hip boots I walked it out as far as I dared 
and jumped in – paddled out to deep water. The waves were big and the 
wind strong. It was as if I had sails. I was busy getting the kicker going 
and not directing my attention to the sea. First thing I knew I was in 
the trough and then on the front side of a big wave. It was good that 
I had a good load and a ballast of rocks or I think it might have rolled 
me. The kicker going and I had trouble turning into the sea. Made it 
and then the pounding started. With each big splash, the wind brought 
about a half gallon of water back into the canoe and on me. Three of 
them and I decided there must be a better way and I headed for the 
beach. Came in exactly where I went out. Jumped out and slid her right 
up on the shore ice.
It is said that the wilderness has unlimited patience – waiting for 
the brush rat to make just one good mistake and then when he has, he 
has had it. The law of average says it will happen if he stays long enough. 
Well, it wouldn’t happen today, Oct. 25 for I was going to tie that raft to 
a little spruce – get under my camera gear and start walking. It would be 
dark before I got to the connecting stream and I could spend the night 
at the Vanderpool cabin there.
As dark as it was I recognized the old native blazed trail in the 
timber when I hit it and followed it a short distanced before crossing 
and heading for the big cotton wood grove and the cabin. It isn’t easy 
to walk right to the cabin in the dark and I missed it by two hundred 
yards but I knew where it was as soon as I hit the cottonwoods. It really 
looked good to me and now I was happy that a few years ago I had 
canoed a heating stove up from the lower end and set it in the cabin. The 
stove had been left on the beach by Oregon campers who had spent a 
month in a big G.I. pyramid tent.
Dark as all get out & I knew there was no lantern there. I felt 
around and got the stove going from fire starter brush and wood cut and 
stacked inside by the last hunters. Feeling around on the table I felt the 
form of a huge candle. I had a few matches and struck one. A big stubby 
red candle three inches across. Now I had light.
 289
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
The lake roared loud and the wind sang a mournful tune in the bare 
branches of the cottonwoods. 
With rare exception, Dick did write about using the motor at times he 
wanted to travel against the wind, which meant in rough waves. Once you 
understand how Dick’s Sears 31/2-hp outboard motor operates it becomes a 
marvel that he was able to orient the canoe into the wind, start the motor 
and then move himself to kneel at mid-ship where he could steer the canoe 
with his long steering handle. The motor was designed to be continuously in 
gear. Having no neutral Dick could only start the motor when the canoe was 
in deep enough water that the propeller did not touch the rocks. For reverse, 
the motor can swivel 180° but this requires the operator to be at the back of 
the craft. The little motor runs Dick’s lightweight canoe at a fast speed even 
when the motor is idling. Dick had a high degree of balance to be able to start 
the motor while bouncing through waves and then turn around, climb over a 
thwart and kneel at mid-ship. 
Before a few of Dick’s canoe paddles and his knee pads were shipped to the 
archives I wanted to take photos and video documenting how his gear operated 
on the canoe. Dennis Bedford, a mechanic for Alaska Airlines, offered to look 
at the motor. Dennis had no problem starting the little air-cooled motor in 
Weisser’s cabin even though it had been more than 10 years since it had run. I 
found it difficult, even on calm water, to start the motor and keep my balance 
while moving to kneel at mid-ship while the canoe was cutting through the 
water.
A length of parachute cord tied to the throttle lever ran through simple 
handcrafted pulleys taped to each side of the motor cowling. The cord then ran 
downward through metal eyes riveted to the gunnel and forward to mid-ship. 
While kneeling at mid-ship Dick controlled the throttle by pulling on the cord.

November 2, 1977: 
Last night in bed I was thinking of building a big candle like the 
stubby one in the Vanderpool cabin. If I could scare up enough candle 
wax I would mold one. In my survival bucket that I some times carry in 
the canoe was a bunch of small stubby candles and I knew of a few more. 
The bucket needed cleaning out and sorting anyway. I came up with a 
bunch of them and put them in a stew pan to melt. For a mold I used a 
23⁄4" pickle jar. Set it on a square of heavy foil and molded the foil around 
it. Wrapped it with string and removed the jar. For a wick I cut a candle 
the proper length, I would set it in the center of my mold and pour the 
wax in. The wax melted and all the short wicks fished out I poured it 
in. I did it outside on the table in 4 degree cold so it would cool quickly. 
Not quick enough for the candle was rapidly decreasing in size. Quickly 
I latched onto the wick with a clothespin and suspended it in the center 
of the mold. Cooling rapidly and I was surprised how much candle wax 
shrinks when it cools. The center dropped considerably and I melted 
more to fill it. In fifteen minutes or so I removed the foil. A big white 
stubby 21⁄2 inch high. The wrinkled foil had given the outside a cut glass 
effect that reflects light and looks professional for rural work.
July 20, 1978: 
Today I would take a little tour so after hotcakes and cabin in visitor 
readiness I hung the little kicker on the stern of the canoe. A couple 
campsites that I wanted to take care of so I took my old long handled no. 
2. I traveled slow to keep the splash down and beached at Glacier Creek.
October 9, 1978: 
Figure out a repair for my good canoe. Too much rough water has 
cracked the forward stiffener across the bottom. It is at that point that she 
pounds when the waves are high. A heavy stone riding there would keep it 
from flexing and cracking but it isn’t always that a heavy stone is available.
October 16, 1978: 
Today, a stay at home day for sure and it was welcome. I had been 
wanting to give my snowshoes, canoe paddles and transom plywood of 
the canoe a coat of Flecto.
November 20, 1978: 
Late fall paddling is cold on the knees when kneeling in the canoe 
with only my sponge rubber knee protectors for insulation so I put my 
canoe sheep skin on the bottom which makes it comfortable.
December 15, 1978: 
The canoe season was about to come to an end. Just as well winter-
ize the little kicker and put it to rest under Spike’s bunk. The canoe I 
 291
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
had planned to drag up on the new ice when it came. Why not load in 
motor and all canoeing gear and make one last little paddle to the point. 
Except for little patches of thin ice there was an open lead up along 
shore. I pulled the plug and gave the cylinder a healthy blast of WD-40 
and it was ready to go. Everything aboard I slid her in off of the packed 
snow and ice and headed up. That good school of minnows disturbed 
the icy surface up along the beach. What would they be doing at the 
surface with ice forming. Snowshoes along to make the drag from the 
point to the cabin. Everything knew its place and seemed anxious to 
turn in for the winter. I doubt that I was there more than thirty min-
utes. Back over the timber trail and I was very much surprised to find 
that the lake had iced over completely from the point on down. Had I 
waited 30 minutes I wouldn’t have paddled.
March 17, 1979: 
… a bottom stiffener for the canoe. It will make it a better craft 
when the going gets sloppy.
March 19, 1979: 
Raymond had made me a canoe bottom stiffener for the Elgin and 
I was anxious to see how it would fit. I took it up, removed a board from 
the near window for light and held it in place. Perfect for length and 
hole locations. I was afraid a rivet or two would interfere. Come break 
up time and the canoe on my beach I will bolt it in place.
In 1985 Dick installed a second bottom stiffener in his canoe.
May 16, 1979: 
Paddling back I decided that the time is now to tighten up some 
rivets in the canoe bottom. Not a bad leaker but just enough to make me 
wonder if I carry it in with the paddle or if it is seeping in. Sitting on the 
beach with the bow high I set the stern on top of a gas can box standing 
on end. Small wedge shaped rocks on the box to keep it from tipping. 
I bailed water into the thing until the offending bottom and lower side 
rivets were covered. Now I could see every leaker and there were quite 
a few. Some showing only a drop of water but a few dripping slowly. 
Holding my anvil bar on the rivets inside I whacked them a couple with 
the hammer on the outside. One by one I stopped the monkey business. 
A few along the keel that I couldn’t get so rubbed some silicone sealer 
over them. Let her set and give her a shake down paddle tomorrow. 5:30 
when I put my tools away.
May 17, 1979: 
The canoe leaked a bit but only a very little and I wrote the location 
in the back of my head.

Chapter 7
July 2, 1979: 
According to Glen my little gas paddle is illegal in the Monument 
but what kind of sense is that. 300 horsepower airplanes on take off 
make more noise pollution in a second than my kicker does in a year. 
I would take it along if I thought the wind would come down the lake 
that it showed no sign of.
July 9, 1979: 
In the sprinkle I did more improving of my beach. The breakwa-
ter is nice and an improvement but it causes problems with an up lake 
wind. Waves coming by the end of the breakwater causes waves to form 
that come to the beach on the lee side of it. These waves carry sand and 
gravel away from the beach instead of building it up. Enough angle to the 
attack of the waves that they move the material around the bend of the 
beach where the heavy surf can pick it up and then, there goes the old 
ball game. Wearing my boots and using the long handle No. 2, I dredged 
up new fill along the eroded area. Comes another blow I will rig a boom 
from the tip of the breakwater and 90 degree to it. Stop that wave action 
from coming in behind. Now that the gravel is gone I think of a method 
of saving it. The day fit for little else except write more letters and that 
I did till after twelve. A breeze came up the lake and the overcast was 
breaking. It would be a partly cloudy afternoon with a medium surf on 
the beach. Not enough to do damage to my fill material.
I wanted to know if my young rams hung tough on Emerson Creek 
flat and later I would test the little kicker by motoring the lumpy lake to 
Low Pass beach. First I wanted to do more to the big birch ladle I had 
started. So – I worked at it an hour before making ready to sail. How to 
tell for sure if gas is mixed for the kicker? I had a can that stood since 
last fall and not sure if it was mixed for the kicker. Reasonably sure but 
not positive. Put a few drops on the warm stove gas mixed with oil will 
evaporate and leave the oil. 100% gas will evaporate completely dry. It 
was kicker mixed sure enough. Now, label the can.
A chance to test the bottom stiffener bar in the canoe also. Second 
pull and the little kicker took off as if eager to prove its worth. Splashy 
rough – a big stone all the way forward in the bow where it would 
aggravate the flexing behind the front seat. I ran faster than I normally 
would to see how it behaved. Solid, no flexing at that point. A bit the 
next one back but only a little. Against a breeze and white capping sea 
that little gas paddle is the only way to go.
October 13, 1979: 
The time was now to store the canoe and little kicker. I loaded 
things to go and paddled up. No problem, the canoe, knows the way 
to its resting place. The little kicker got a good blast of WD-40 in the 
combustion chamber before crawling under the bed.

The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
July 21, 1980: 
My canoe could stand a cleaning so I took a “Scotch brite” scouring 
cloth backed by a sponge. Warm soapsuds to help cut the grime. It came 
out looking real good. 
August 3, 1980: 
Glen had mail and grub for me. My L.L. Bean double ender paddle 
came. Spuds, flour, onions, rice, peanut butter and more. How much 
and I would pay him now $26.00. 
The lake mildly rough and I had to try that double ender paddle. 
Good alright but a wet operation. Water runs down that up ended shaft. 
I would have a gallon of water in the canoe before reaching Emerson 
Creek. In a kayak that is decked over it would be better. A kayak paddle 
is what it is.
August 4, 1980: 
Only a light breeze up and I wanted to try my kayak paddle again. 
This time to the good beach below one-mile rock and from there I 
would check that slope for blueberries. Blades of the paddle set 90° to 
each other so the blade in the air is feathered and causing very little drag 
against the breeze. That is the recommended setting. Again I had a lot 
of water falling into the canoe from the blade overhead. I was wearing 
my above the knee bobbed pants and knees on my sponge rubber knee 
protectors. Those I tossed on the seat to prevent them from soaking and 
a long time drying. I made good time but took on a gallon of water.

Chapter 7
August 9, 1980: 
Last evening after my journal entry I decided to learn if my brag 
of cutting travel time by one third with the double ender kayak paddle 
was true. I seldom carry a watch and maybe it was that it only seemed a 
much faster canoe.
August 23, 1980: 
Today I would use my good old L.L. Bean canoe paddle. I really 
don’t approve of those huge white plastic blades waving overhead and 
throwing water in the canoe and across it.
This white, plastic double-ended kayak paddle was the L.L.Bean paddle 
that arrived three weeks earlier.
October 2, 1980: 
I launched the canoe and with the double paddle kicker I headed for 
Glacier Creek and beyond. A light breeze coming down and that sloppy 
paddle was dripping on my knees. I had made one improvement and 
needed another before I venture out again. I found that the end boards 
of gas can boxes when placed end to end in the bot-
tom of the canoe will form a shallow V thusly 
My knees on the elevated ends should stay dry. 
So – I used my rubber knee protectors and got them 
water logged from dripping water. 
After crossing Twin Lakes to identify wildlife tracks in the snow along 
the opposite shore, Dick starts his paddle back home below.
At Glacier Creek I beached to dump the water out of the bilges. 
Walked the beach a bit to loosen up my very cold knees and then headed 
for Carrither’s point.
Darned if the breeze wasn’t coming up the lake now and I would 
have those paddleing drops on my knees again.
Biscuits baking and I worked on my stay dry arrangement for the 
canoe. The gas can ends I hinged in the center to keep them close. I 
remembered a black polyethylene apron, I had made years back, for 
packing wet boulders at Terry & Vic’s diggings. Just what I need – the 
sponge protection between my knees and the apron. Now I am ready 
and eager to head for the way down lower end.
Dick also used this black polyethylene apron when he was packing rocks 
to make his breakwater to protect his J-3 in 1975. The apron helped keep his 
pants from getting too wet.
October 5, 1980: 
About one and I took a break from my writing and launched the 
canoe for an afternoon drive up the lake. The double ender paddle was 
The ends of a gas-can box, hinged to fit 
the bottom of the canoe to keep Dick’s 
knees dry. (Photo by Monroe Robinson)

The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
my little kicker. Paddling on both sides makes it easier to watch both 
sides of the lake and I was interested in moose.
A breeze had followed me up and now a chance for the fancy paddle 
to prove its worth. The lake just short of the white cap stage and I found 
it much easier to propel and hold a course than with a canoe paddle. I 
was making better time than with my L.L. Bean under ideal conditions.
December 1, 1980: 	
Come back straight across. Lots of ice just forming. So thin it only 
made the water a dull finish. No sound from the paddle or canoe. Hand 
size and larger, lots of it. The paddle pulled sluggish as if the water was 
like syrup. I have noticed that before at the critical stage between water 
and ice. I thought it was my imagination. Then, Babe remarked only 
last year when he and Mary was here. He had noticed it when flying his 
old T craft on floats. The water heavier and more solid. Coming back I 
paddled through ice that broke and rattle against paddle and canoe.
April 13, 1981: 
I stopped at Spike’s cabin for my short L.L. Bean canoe paddle 
(not my pride and joy 51/2 footer). It had broken and I had made a neat 
tapered splice in the shaft. Glued it and then wrapped it with super tape. 
In time the glued joint had come apart but the tape still made it entirely 
serviceable. I wanted to glue it with some “Elmers” professional wood glue.
I guessed the time at 1 P.M. for now the sun was looking down. 
I found it 1:10 at my cabin. Lunch and then I mended the paddle. 
Wrapped it very tight with cord until the glue dries and then I’ll replace 
the cord with tape.
April 25, 1981: 
From Jake a package of assorted items and among them… The 3 
foot length of 11/8" aluminum tubing to extend the length of my double 
ender paddle.
July 4, 1981: 
Not often that July 4th has new ice. I used my L.L. Bean canoe 
paddle because it was such a pretty morning. The double ender (alumi-
num and plastic) takes some thing away from the experience.
August 2, 1981: 
Steve Pasniak and when he crawled out I wondered. Too much 
belly for a mt. man and I would have to load the stern of the canoe to 
trim it with him in the bow. Sig [Alsworth] was along too. From here 
they wanted to fly to a lake beyond the Bonanza Hills to get a junker 
206 ready to helicopter out. Too much gas aboard and so they drained 
10 gals. out to leave here. Where had he been in Alaska. Well, it was a 
tour package and he rattled off the names including Nome. He had seen 
more of Alaska than I.

Chapter 7
The lake had calmed and his time was short – we have better make 
the best of it. How about a little paddle. Fine he would like that. Last 
summer he had canoed the Boundary Waters of Canada & Minnesota. 
I learned later he had been many places and one of them China. I placed 
some stones in the stern way back but even with the ballast the canoe 
acted as if it would like to dunk him and me when he got in. A real 
strong man on the paddle – reached way forward and came way back but 
I noticed he didn’t feather his paddle which separates the long timers 
from the short time paddlers. We went across to the mouth of Falls 
Creek. He heard of my shower bath and maybe after our day tomorrow 
he would feel like a shower was needed. We came back to Carrithers’ 
point and there he came so near turning us over I was a little spooky 
about him in the canoe with me. Past nine when we came to the cabin 
and got him squared away to use the lower bunk. He says “you prefer 
the upper” and I said, “yes the top one is mine. 
“That’s ok if you would rather” he said as if I was the visitor. He had 
his own sleeping bag. Would he snore was my concern … before I blew 
out the cow barn lantern and climbed the ladder.
September 8, 1981: 
At the canoe some varmint had pulled my knee protectors down 
and damaged one. Tooth marks and it must have been a bear that did it. 
Some “barge” cement would repair it.
October 7, 1981:
The double ender is not a cold weather paddle. Water dripping into 
the canoe from the blades makes ice on everything above the water line 
and that includes me.
October 27, 1981: 
Following the shoreline I picked up a few good sticks and sawed 
three more good blocks from the log that made a good load. Again that 
up the lake breeze but this time I had the double ender paddle along. 
The canoe riding lower and those 8-inch wide blades going down into 
solid footing. It was work but I was making better time than I could 
have traveling light and using the single blade.
June 5, 1982: 
I had moved the canoe out near the breakwater and parallel to the 
water line and maybe five feet from it. About mid morning there came 
a terrific blast of wind that made things rattle. I heard the canoe rattle 
and looked up to see it flop into the water and right side up. No prob-
lem, I had the snout of it tied to a hefty rock. Years back I went out one 
morning intending to use it – no canoe.
 297
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
June 27, 1983: 
No plane so I turned my attention to the canoe. Dingy dull and 
rough on the bottom from scraping over rocks. I used my aluminum 
oxide stone with water to knock the pimples off, then fine sand and a 
rag to scrub the dull grey scum off. I thought of my abrasive sponge 
intended for sanding wood and found that it did a good job. No plane 
came and I spent considerable time on the bottom and finished by filing 
the keel smooth.
July 16, 1983:
The canoe leaked a few drops of water and this afternoon I would 
see if I could make it completely watertight. I rested the stern on the 
slope of the breakwater and a box under the bow. A few buckets of water 
into it and then lay on the gravel and watch the drops of water form and 
drip. I marked the rivets with a felt tip (7 total) – dumped the water and 
with the canoe on its side I used the head of the splitter for a bucking 
bar and the rock hammer for a rivet gun. Next launching will tell if it 
was a job well done.
May 11, 1984: 
For this trip I would wear my good cow barn rubber boots with a 
pair of insoles to give more support under my feet for that is where they 
get sore after a dozen miles. How long from my beach to the cabin at 
the head of Lake Trout Bay? With the canoe and L.L.Bean paddle I 
can make it in 2 hrs. 20 min. With the double ender I can do it just 
under 2 hrs.
May 26, 1984: 
After supper I took the canoe, my 2 x 8’s, auger and measuring stick 
and moved out to the ice. One 2x8 along the edge, the other extending 
eight feet onto the ice. Auger went through too easy and yet I could put 
my weight on the ice and very little squeaking. Ice at 10".
July 10, 1984: 
I sawed and split a batch while the afternoon puckered for a rain 
shower. A fair breeze came up the lake and wasn’t I glad I stayed home 
today. I don’t know of anything quite so wet as a canoe on a large lake in 
a shower. Water above, below and on all sides.
December 9, 1984: 
I had kept my L.L. Bean canoe paddle here for a varnish touch up 
before storing it with the canoe and motor. The tip and edges of the 
blade had been scuffed. Some epoxy glue warmed and rubbed on with 
my finger gave it a more durable finish than a thin coat of varnish.

Chapter 7
May 27, 1985: 
I wanted to install the new rib-stiffening bar in the bottom of the 
canoe so traveled the edge of the ice to the point and wrestled it out of 
storage. Last fall I had the pole supports under the purlin logs ham-
mered tight and today I found them carrying no load at all. That heavy 
snow load had seated them solid in the gravel.
Got the bar in no problem and now it is in better shape for rough 
water and the little kicker on the stern.
June 21, 1986: 
I was awake many times the few hours I slept in the [Vanderpool] 
cabin. I was too cool and the mosquitoes found me there. I finally had to 
use bug dope to keep them away. It is a dark cabin with the two win-
dows covered with poles. When the light began to improve I figured it 
was maybe 2 AM so I soon got up and prepared to come on up one way 
or another. It was calm at the cabin and only the sound of fast flow-
ing Emerson Creek. For breakfast I had the last half of a granola bar 
and headed for the beach. It was still rough but not too bad. Trouble, 
the wind was against the beach and danger of getting thrown on the 
beach or into shallow water before I could get the little kicker running. 
I shoved out and used the paddle to get to deep water and then started 
the motor. It was cold and died before I got lined out. Going again and 
before I knew it I was in shallow water and sheared a pin in the pro-
peller. So I dragged her out and installed a new pin. This time I would 
get plenty far out for I was using my last shear pin. I got her going and 
got lined out for Low Pass beach. It was a rough pounding ride even 
when I quartered that big 7th wave. I made it across and was sailing up 
the shoreline and maybe 200 yards off shore when I noticed it steer-
ing strange. I was using my remote control set up which consists of a 
long tiller [steering]  handle and two lines – one for faster and the other 
slower. They are tied to a cross bar of the canoe. I was facing ahead and 
not looking back for I had big waves to take care of. Again it didn’t act 
right on the tiller. I looked back just in time to see the motor about to 
fall off of the stern. One side was already free of the transom and the 
other nearly so. The motor at a very cockeyed angle. Before I could stop 
the motor it came free and fell into the lake. I was surprised how long 
it ran before it drowned. All that kept it from going to the bottom was 
the fuel line and my two throttle control lines. So there I was bobbing 
around in the rough water with the faithful little kicker under the canoe. 
I fished it out and applied the paddle. It was a struggle but I made it 
to the good beach below one-mile rock. There I reorganized my load 
forward so I could control the canoe better in the wind. I didn’t try the 
kicker for running as it was when it went under it would suck in water. I 
came on and true to past experience in down lake winds – when I get to 
one-mile rock the battle is won. I can always make it from there.
 299
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
It was 4 AM when I came to the cabin. “Sure tasted good to be back 
home”… The little kicker I hung on the saw buck motor rack and pro-
ceeded to get to the points and remove carburetor. No water in the point 
compartment. I pulled the starter cord many times with the spark plug 
removed to blow the water out. The spark plug was drying on the stove. 
I found water in the carburetor. Everything dried out and back together. 
I filled the carburetor with the squeeze bulb in the fuel line and it 
started and ran perfect the second pull of the starter cord. Putting the 
motor on I had snugged the clamps up but evidently not tight enough. 
A safety cord tied from motor to canoe is needed, but it won’t happen 
again, I will see to that. In very rough water such a caper might lead 
to a disaster. So now the little kicker is ready willing and able to battle 
another rough lake.
The day before Dick’s journal entry above, he canoed to Emerson Creek 
before hiking 8 miles up and over a mountain pass 3,900 feet above Twin 
Lakes, in an unsuccessful effort to meet Fred Hirschmann at the Dall sheep 
mineral lick. Not finding Fred, he hiked back to Emerson Creek via the lon-
ger route - first to the lower end of Lower Twin Lake and then through the 
forest to Upper Twin Lakes where he found the water too rough to canoe. 
The Vanderpool cabin kept Dick from spending the night without shelter on 
many occasions. Its location allowed Dick to hike farther without the weight 
of camping gear and to return to Upper Twin Lakes without risking a lake 
crossing when the wind was too hard.
July 28, 1986: 
I had fixed a leak coming by a screw in the bottom of the canoe 
before I left and it leaked worse – how can that be? 
July 29, 1986: 
After breakfast and chores I neatened up the outside area and 
watered the roof that is looking real good. I corrected that leak in the 
canoe bottom by putting a gasket under that flat head screw.
August 14, 1986: 
I hung the little “Sears and row back” [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] on the 
stern of the canoe and she approved.
September 22, 1986: 
A change of pace in the form of an order to “wear guard” [Wearguard 
Co.] for a couple pair of cotton polyester pants and new kneeling pads for 
in the canoe.
November 22, 1986: 
After breakfast and the cabin in order I decided to paddle across and 
check the beach for bear tracks … As I paddled across the fog started 
300 
	
Chapter 7
up this lake. A man can get lost in the fog on this lake if he doesn’t have 
the sound of Hope Creek and the high waterfall to guide him.
On the far shore tracks of a sheep. Big tracks wide spaced and I 
would guess it a big ram. It appeared that the sheep went down and 
back up or up and back down. Never had I seen sheep tracks on that 
beach before. So, I paddled down the shoreline watching the tracks. He 
went nearly to Jerre’s point and then turned around and headed back up. 
The fog bank was moving up and would blanket my return route but no 
problem. A light breeze would be there to guide me. I went on down 
to check the moose remains. Nothing had fed on the skin but again I 
found rabbit tracks on the beach there.
I shoved off and headed for Hope Creek or where I figured it would 
be. I would keep the proper angle with the ruffled water. Soon I was out 
into it and might just as well have been on the ocean. Keeping my head-
ing about right was not easy. Now and again I would find myself headed 
too much up the lake so I would turn more and expect to hit below 
Erv’s cabin. I paddled and paddled and nothing appeared. A big plane 
came over and I recognized the sound. It would be going almost directly 
down the lake. He should cross my course but he seemed to be going the 
opposite direction that I was. That would make me going up the lake. If 
I missed Carrithers point I might go a long ways up. So I paddled and 
paddled. I was frosting up. My toes were cold and ice was forming on 
the shaft of the paddle and on the canoe above water line.
At last, trees on the steep slope. That would be below Erv’s and I 
could bear a little left and hit Hope Creek. Soon the trees ended and 
that shouldn’t be. Here I was touring along the base of Crag mountain 
above Carrithers point. I had paddled twice the distance of my intended 
course. Now I had to paddle against that cool breeze which was more 
south than I thought. When I came in the cabin it was near 12 o’clock 
noon. Had it been dead calm there is no telling when or where I would 
have found the shoreline. In summer and dead calm I have crossed the 
lake in dense fog. Had the sound of Hope Creek and the high falls not 
been there I would be thoroughly lost.
September 18, 1987: 
Again I flew my good flag in case I had company coming and then 
proceeded to look for a round head wood screw for my canoe repair. The 
rivet through two thicknesses of aluminum and directly over the wood 
transom. The second thickness of aluminum split and released the rivet. 
I would run a wood screw through both and into the transom. No did 
find a round head wood screw so I would use a stove bolt. Drill the hole 
a bit small, make the screw self-threading and bed every thing in epoxy 
glue. It looked good and is guaranteed for the duration.
October 5, 1987: 
Fog came and closed in pretty snug but before it did he asked me 
 301
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
if he could use the canoe to cross the lake. He wanted to climb to the 
waterfall. After his [Steve Pasniak] shipwreck with a canoe in Minnesota 
I wasn’t about to turn him loose with my canoe and told him, no, I never 
let my canoe go unless I go with it.
November 1, 1988: 
To make it pay a little bit I took my wood cutting tools and cut a 
canoe load of wood a quarter mile up from Dick Weisser’s cabin along 
the lakeshore. Good dry tree and as the breeze was calming I took the 
canoe up to bring it down. 
April 17, 1989: 
To occupy my waiting time I went to Spikes cabin for a broken 
canoe paddle. An L.L. Bean paddle and a good one. It finally broke 
square off and I shortened it 4 inches in making a splice. I intended it 
for a woman’s paddle but Fred got a hold of it and crack! It was weak 
from then on and got to the point where I retired it until I thought of a 
better splice without making it weak. I finally came up with the answer 
and I wanted to try it. Saw a slot lengthwise 12 inches long in the pad-
dle shaft (6 inches on each side of the splice). Make that slot 3/16 inch 
wide and make a hardwood spline to fit snug and the length of the slot. 
The spline thicker in the old splice area and tapering to 1/8 inch on the 
ends. Now all I need is some real good wood glue.
May 8, 1989: 
I did a tour in the woodshed after sanding smooth the shaft of my 
repaired canoe paddle. Used as a woman’s paddle I guarantee it.
May 9, 1989: 
I won’t be using the canoe for a month at least but no harm to bring 
it down so I coaxed it out of its winter quarters and towed it down the 
hard frozen ice.
May 16, 1989: 
My pool out front had expanded to the extent that I can no longer 
get on the lake ice with out using the canoe and a plank.
June 3, 1989: 
What to use to clean the dingy grime from my canoe. An SOS pad 
does good but I have so few I hate to use one for that. I had a rough 
green pad that is very durable. Backed with a sponge it might do it. So 
with good warm detergent fortified water I tried it and it worked good. 
Washed and ironed the little ol’ craft looked good.
February 27, 1991: 
I arrived to see lots of gear parked on the ice and part of it was those 
302 
	
Chapter 7
heavy moose antlers due to fly to North Carolina with Laurie [sister of 
Christina “Chris” Degeneres]. No moose antlers in North Carolina was her 
reason for taking them. Again I heard that she is women’s canoe cham-
pion of Minnesota and she is not very big or heavy. She owns about 
fifteen canoes. I would sure like to see her in action on this lake. With 
her racing canoe she can go 5-6 miles per hour she says. I can do four 
for a while with my old square stern Elgin tin “Canooo”.
June 21, 1991: 
There was no warning as when it comes marching up the lake 
and takes an hour to get here. I put the little kicker on the stern for to 
paddle against a breeze with a 55-gallon drum in a canoe is like sailing 
against the wind.
July 4, 1991: 
On the shore of the upper lake I rigged a bridle for the canoe. 
Canoes don’t tow good at all from the bowline anchor hole. You must 
rig to lift the bow. Put the load in the stern. It towed real good.
July 24, 1991:
This morning I had a couple urgent letters to write. One to Erv 
Terry concerning his 2-55 gal. drums cached in the brushy well behind 
the beach at his plane tie up spot. I wanted to buy both so we will have 
gas for the J-3 cub when brother Ray comes. Erv in a letter, quoted me 
a price of $300.00 for the 100 gal. of gas. That is about 2.75 a gal. and 
Glen charges 3.50 per gal. 
… About 400 lbs. per drum and much uneven ground willows, dead 
buried trees, big spruce to make it interesting. Pretty heavy lifting and 
pushing, would I feel it tomorrow? I used my long 1/2 inch nylon line 
to “parbuckle” (line to tree and under and over the drum from the back 
side. Pull on the free end and you have twice the rolling power.) I was 
a little surprised at my good time getting the 1st one to the beach. The 
2nd was easier for now I knew just how to do it. So, now they stand on 
the beach waiting to float to mine. A full drum of gas will float due to 
weighing 7 lbs. per gal where water is 8 lbs. per gal. … Tomorrow the 
old can-oo and the little kicker will become a tug boat. 
Dick is planning ahead for Raymond’s return with the rebuilt J-3 Cub. 
He would now have gas at Twin Lakes for them to fly. He was 75 years old 
when he moved the 400-pound drums of gas into the lake. The following day 
he rolled them uphill and into the forest near his cabin.
July 25, 1991: 
Before I went to sleep I had planned just how I would move those 
2 drums of Avgas to my beach. Tie a rope around each one separately. 
Roll them in the lake and tie one on each side of the canoe and well 
 303
The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
forward. Crank up the little kicker and come motoring to my beach. 
Free them from the canoe and use my favorite rolling hitch to get them 
out of the water, up the beach and back into the timbered point.
November 22, 1991: 
Fog down country prevented me from seeing the condition there. At 
any rate tonight would do it for complete freeze up.
No more need for the canoe and associated gear so I would start 
putting it away. The little kicker I lashed on the G.I. pack board and my 
arms would be loaded with paddles, fuel tank, life vests and kneeling 
pads. Tomorrow I would take the “ol tin canoo” by the nose and walk 
it up the ice. Another canoe season completed without accident. Some 
say “you should have a sail for your canoe”. I insist that my chances are 
much better with out a sail.
June 4, 1992: 
This morning I would urethane my snowshoes – get them ready for 
over the mantle display. I wish I knew how many miles I have walked 
on that same pair. Used them every winter I have stayed at Twin Lakes 
and often in spring and fall when I didn’t.
I had just completed my project including canoe paddles, canoe tran-
som, and a few touch-up jobs when I heard an airplane down country.
July 1, 1992:
 It was Mark Lang who came in to the beach… we headed for Port 
Alsworth. 
I found brother Jake in the junk pile getting the J-3 floats ready 
for a couple new bulkheads. Good to see him after nine years. Some 
bad news. Instead of one steel bulkhead to replace there was two. 
Fortunately he had made two of aluminum … Raymond (Jake) was soon 
drilling out the old rivets. Glen’s mechanics would drop by often to see 
how we were doing and comment on Raymond’s expert workmanship… 
The float repair went well and I had hopes of getting away by the 4th of 
July. A big picnic scheduled for that day and I would see many strange 
faces. It would have been nice if Babe and Mary could have been there. 
Babe and Mary Alsworth retired to Hawaii.
July 4, 1992:
Now both Raymond and I had a bad cold and I felt pretty miserable. 
He got it first so he would start to improve first.
Small tinkering jobs to complete the float installation. Glen declared 
a rock pick up day for his crew [removing large rocks from the airstrip]. 
Now, the cub was ready to launch in Babe’s Bay but we had to 
attend the picnic first. People arrived from all sides. I have never seen so 
many strange faces about “The Farm”. Food, lots of it. More cakes than 
304

The Elgin & the Arctic Tern
I had seen in one collection for a long time. It is easy to see why people 
suffer. If what you eat is what you are I could see ample reason for many 
disorders. I feel sure I could survive longer on my Twin Lakes diet. 
Now it was time to put the little yellow bird in the water. Glen 
wanted to go along with Raymond to check him out on floats after not 
flying floats for about 17 years. “Wait till I get a pair of hip boots on” he 
said and soon he was back ready to fly. They took off and we didn’t see 
them for awhile. When they came to the beach, Glen’s comment was 
“It’s a real nice airplane, but it is so light”! Now we were ready to take 
off for Twin Lakes …
At my beach it seemed good to be back. Gear unloaded and tails of 
the floats pulled up on the beach next to the rock pile. It was 1976 when 
Cub 7335Hotel last rested its heels on that beach. After the big picnic 
dinner we didn’t need much for supper. 
August 9, 1992: 
The up lake wind had worked on the beach. It brings gravel to one 
spot and removes it from another. Always moving it farther up the shore-
line. The cub in a perfectly protected spot in the lee of the breakwater 
rock pile. Jake with rake and me with no. 2 shovel prettied it up again.
Raymond sold the Cub to a young Norwegian pilot, Martin Kviteng. 
Martin visits Dick’s cabin each summer as a fishing guide. He told me he has 
never seen a plane built to the level of perfection of Raymond Proenneke’s 
J-3 Cub.
Every summer at least one visitor would ask the whereabouts of Dick and 
Raymond’s J-3 Cub. In 2013, Donald Rogers from New Hampshire decided 
to look for the plane. The following year he sent us a photo with N7335H 
printed on the well-cared-for yellow J-3 Cub. Its new owner, from Virginia, 
knew of the plane’s one-time owner, Dick Proenneke.
December 9, 1992: 
The old canoe had gone in for how many times now. It could lay 
bottom up outside and suffer no damage but it has been good to me (no 
upsets) and deserves a good winter home.
January 11, 1993: 
All day it would get steadily worse with white coming in mid 
afternoon. I crossed the lake in mukluks and found too much over flow. 
Terrible, and it will take a lot of severe cold to correct it.
I wrote letters after lunch and I can’t make much head way till the 
light is failing. I would write more after supper, with the sound of an up 
lake wind and there would be snow and drifting. The canoe in Spike’s 
cabin is lined with Xmas packages. I go in and fill my pockets with loot 
to last a few days.

October 14, 1993: 
This morning I would do it. Some thing waiting for dead calm. Me 
solo in the canoe – how many paddle strokes from Carrithers’ point to 
my beach. Best I ever did with the LL Bean single blade wood paddle 
was 75 strokes. Could I do better by adding or removing ballast? Could 
I do better by moving ballast forward and me back or adding more 
ballast or no ballast at all? I was cooking a pot of beans so after each run 
over the course I came in to check. With more ballast I got as high as 85 
strokes. With my constant companion rock all the way forward and me 
behind the rear cross thwart I did it in 73 strokes. I could do nearly as 
well with no ballast rock but not as easy. I will settle for 73 and dare any 
“wanna-be” canoe paddler to equal it. A breeze came up the lake to stop 
the foolishness.
December 17, 1993: 
The lake ice very treacherous under the light snow cover and careful 
as I was I fell but not hard. The upper lake starting to ripple. I paddled 
for a mile and then motored to one-mile rock and then paddled again. 
The canoe season is near over and I welcome one last good paddle.
May 21, 1994: 
The ice a long way down and maybe tomorrow evening will see it 
gone. First after breakfast a bath and laundry. I packed in a little more 
bough wood. The day was fair and I decided to varnish my snowshoes, 
canoe paddles and transom on the canoe.
November 15, 1994: 
Snow was pelting the window. The wind terribly strong. How cold 
was it? Flashlight in hand I opened the door. Snow was streaking by 
horizontally nearly a solid mass. I didn’t step out but guessed at the 
temp. 25°. Fortunately it didn’t last more than 30 minutes. Before I 
went to sleep I thought, how fortunate can a brush rat be. My canoe 
– now suppose it had drifted down lake into the night. I couldn’t start 
till morning. If it were on the far side beach I would have to ford the 
stream. If it went through into the lower lake it would go five miles far-
ther and if it hit the river Ho Boy! I hate to think about it. As it turned 
out I will have lots to be thankful for come Thanksgiving day.
Dick is remembering the strong wind 24 years earlier that flipped his 
canoe, breaking the tie-down rope and blowing it into the lake.
September 11, 1995: 
 I had a very busy day. Put my rifle gun away in the cache. 
Urethaned canoe paddles and canoe transom, shovel handles, axe han-
dles and splitter handle and more. Did some heavy washing. Repaired a 
meter test lead, set and filed the big bow saw blade.

Dick sanded where needed and applied additional finish like Flecto 
Varathane or Humi-Cure on wood handles regularly. Dick’s care of the han-
dles of his tools and handcrafted items is reflected in the excellent condition 
they were left when he departed Twin Lakes. 
May 5, 1996: 
Boxed up some surplus from “Alaska Wilderness Lodge” last fall 
and sledded it up the ice to Spike’s cabin. The canoe was begg’n to get 
out so I wrestled it out and towed it down the ice.
May 21, 1996: 
Chinned the bar 20 times with snow falling on my head. I do 
believe that chinning the bar is the way to get an early start into dream 
land. Never dreamed it would snow more during the night … Leon 
intended to fly up this way today and as far as Two Lakes. Ho Boy! a 
chance to get my mail dropped. No problem he said. I had checked the 
ice. It was 15" and very soft under the auger but not squeaking under 
foot yet. He could have landed with the cub on 30" tires but I said “don’t 
do it”. There is no need for that.
In due time I heard the cub. I got on the radio to tell him I would 
be on the creek flat. He said “there is a box in your mail. It shakes like it 
might be candy or cookies I hate to drop it. I will make a touch and go

and set it on the ice as I go by. Take the canoe with you to go get it if the 
ice is very bad.” I told him I had been out on the ice and found it good. 
“Could a plane land”. Yes it could but don’t do it – not that important. 
So he went rolling by to make a mark for reference and then next time 
around he followed the tracks and with his right hand set a mail sack in 
the snow. It slid a very few feet … I took the canoe to the ice floe and 
went out to retrieve the mail sack. Not a lot of mail when I dumped it 
on the carpet.
October 12, 1996: 
Right away after chores I paddled the canoe up to the point and 
dragged it to the door of Spike’s cabin. Dragged it in as far as it would 
go on the floor. Gary [Titus] and Sharon [a friend of Gary’s] were due to 
come over and help me lift the nose so it would come all the way in and 
let the door close. 30 minutes later I came back by Hope’s cabin and here 
came Gary. He couldn’t get his Honda outboard running. Took it in the 
cabin and warmed it to find there had been ice in the carburetor. Before 
he came I suddenly hit on a plan to do the heavy lifting on the canoe. 
Take my lever hoist and lift from the beam directly above the center of 
the canoe. It worked – easiest I have ever put the canoe inside.

Dick Proenneke lived isolated in miles, but not in spirit. Many visitors came 
as friends. Others visited and became friends. Dick paid attention to people 
both when he was with you and through correspondence. If you wrote Dick, 
he wrote you back. It is hard to imagine an individual who chose to live as 
remotely as Dick while also nourishing relationships as he did.
Dick’s handcrafted gifts of bowls, spoons and knives can not be separated 
from his relationship with family, friends and community. His journaling 
and letter writing fits comfortably alongside his handcrafted gifts. Imagine 
having dozens of letters to mail through a post office many air miles away, not 
have any postage stamps and not knowing when someone would fly in with 
mail and be willing to take outgoing mail.

Far more people sent Dick provisions and gifts than this chapter touches 
upon. Here are just a few people who touched Dick’s life, and whose lives were 
touched in return.  
July 7, 1968:
On up to Lofstedt’s cabin to return a couple magazines bor-
rowed last winter and to search for a good ladder pole. The mission at 
Nondalton needs a ladder. Babe liked the one I built for my cache and 
said he would fly one out for the mission if I would build it. It shall be 
done. The mission girls gone home state side for a year. I hope Babe 
doesn’t forget who the ladder belongs to before they come back.
July 31, 1968:
I had been thinking that I could use a big wooden spoon to spoon 
my hotcake batter on to the griddle – one spoon full one hotcake. I had 
looked through my scraps of stump wood and found a couple pieces that 
looked suitable. I doubt if it took more than an hour to turn out a good 
looking spoon. I have more wood and I could use a wooden bowl or two.
August 14, 1968: 
This morning on my way to the cabin for lunch I searched for a 
spruce tree with a burl. I had seen one in the back forty. I found a big 
dead tree with one but it isn’t too good. I would cut it off and make a 
wooden bowl.
August 24, 1968: 
I have been thinking of trying to turn out a wooden bowl from 
stump wood. I hollowed it out easy enough but cut it too thin on the 
outside and broke a chunk out so made kindling of it.
November 22, 1968:
I sawed and split some wood and made myself a real nice candle-
holder from a spruce burl.
February 12, 1969: 
Overcast, a strong breeze down the lake and a +25°. I was really 
surprised after it being a -26°.
Just like spring – I would take advantage of it and carve out a big 
wooden spoon for Mary Alsworth in exchange for the heavy boot sox. 
I dug out a good looking stump from the deep snow and went to work. 
She ordered a spoon with lots of curve to it so that is the way it would 
be. Nice to be working wood again and not uncomfortable with the 
temp. a weak 30°. The camp robbers kept me company and one sang a 
solo. I haven’t heard one sing but a few times but this one sat in a tree 
near where I worked at my bench and sang for nearly five minutes – he 
was really happy with the change in temperature.

February 13, 1969:
A little squirrel came by as I worked at the woodshed and I watched 
to see if he acted familiar. He didn’t make the usual circuit checking 
the stump and butcher block for bones so he is a stranger. With the 
snow settled he was able to get over the top in fair shape. A wood scrap 
from the spoon just about right to make a fork so I marked one out and 
went to work. Under the shed roof at the saw buck – I heard a gentle 
warbling. There just across from me perched on a tree branch was my 
little friend, his throat working and a song that could be easily heard. 
I waited until he was through then cut some meat scraps and put them 
on the chopping block not three feet from me. Now we had the magpies 
outsmarted. He would take the meat to the brushy lower branches and 
eat it there. Nothing but friendly when he is alone but if the other jays 
are there he hangs back and you would never know him from the others. 
The fork completed and it looks pretty good. Still time to saw and 
split a few blocks.
April 5, 1969: 
A wooden spoon marked out (makes 10 I have made) so while 
tending my cooking I sawed it out, scooped out the bowl – trimmed the 
outside and rasp it to shape. Sand it smooth – if only I was better fixed 
for good coarse sandpaper.
April 13, 1969:
I roughed out a bowl from a spruce burl using wood auger and 
gouge chisel.
April 20, 1969:
A good time to try Jakes coarse emery cloth – finish the spoon I had 
in the making. Sand a big spruce burl tabletop and work on the bowl 
that I had roughed out. Inside curves are hard on emery cloth. Seems 
no time and it is like a rag with no abrasive on it. I rounded the end of 
a stick of 2 in. spruce from my woodpile. Took my bowl up to the point 
and dry fine sand, a hand full of sand and much elbow grease to rotate 
the stick did a fair job. Much like a poor mans sand blaster.
April 25, 1969:
Time to sand the inside of my spruce burl bowl. A gift to Mary 
Alsworth when I get it finished. Payment for all the extra good things 
to eat that she has sent and for the good mail service. I moved out under 
the overhang to sand and keep an eye on the lake in case some wild 
animal might venture out on it.
June 7, 1969:
The first cut of the big burl – what to make of it. Hollow it out and 
make a super bowl or planter. I went to work with the 11⁄ 2 inch auger. 
Dick used these felt pads with sandpaper 
wrapped over the felt.

Ninety-one holes to get it ready to hollow out with axe and chisel.
June 9, 1969:
Today I would work on my big spruce burl bowl. A lot of work and I 
was filling a box with chips. Gouging away and the chisel went over the 
edge and sliced across the knee of my new Frisco jeans. Only a cut an 
inch long but exactly where they take the most wear. Lucky that I didn’t 
cut my knee. As it was I was only scratched. By noon still not done but 
getting down to the proper thickness. Enough of that exercise for today.
July 8, 1969: 
A small burl standing by. I would see if I could turn out a bowl 
while it rained…This one would be a mini bowl – only 4 in. x 5 and 15/8 
in. deep. Considerable work goes into hollowing out a burl and sanding 
it smooth.
July 23, 1969:
About a week ago while traveling down country high in the timber 
and brush below Gold mountain I came across a down tree – dead and 
with a good burl on the side. A thick one that would make a good bowl 
about 12 inches or more in diameter and maybe five inches deep. I half 
surveyed the location so I might find it again.
June 24, 1971
I worked on outgoing mail nearly all morning. Film to pack and let-
ters to write. One full bottle of Sheaffers Skrip ink used since May 16.
May 28, 1972:
I was looking for a spruce burl to make a bowl about six or eight 
inches across. It would have to come from a dead tree and still be sound.
May 29, 1972:
Some time to kill till lunch so I gouged out the burl. Not finished by 
any means but the rough work three fourths done.
June 4, 1972: 
Today I would stay home. The bowl and spoons to finish. More 
sanding and then three coats of Humicure (plastic finish) at two-hour 
intervals. Write letters and do other odd jobs in between coats.
June 9, 1972:
If I could find a suitable burl I would make another bowl. I wan-
dered about, thinking I might see a spruce grouse. I haven’t seen one for 
several days now. A burl on a dead tree but it wasn’t much. I marked the 
spot by lining up east Cowgill peak and the caribou lying on the bench. 
I found another not far from Spike’s cabin but on a green tree.

Go back and saw that no good burl from the tree.
June 15, 1972:
Gouged out the no good burl bowl until I noticed that I had devel-
oped & broken a blister.
August 10, 1973:
I gently closed the door and with axe & saw headed for the woods. 
I knew of a snag that could come in. In my travels I came onto a burl 
attached to a rotted out snag so I sawed it off. Nature had completed 
half of the work of hollowing this one.
August 24, 1973:
Lunch past and for want of something to do I started on the burl I 
had salvaged from the floating tree. This one solid wood and it would 
take some gouging to hollow it out. First many holes with my 3/8 auger 
and then the sharp gouge chisel. Getting well done when here came an 
airplane.
September 13, 1973
It rained a steady rain and I wrote letters till 5:15. Just about caught 
up and only a half bottle of ink left out of three and a half starting May 
9. I’m using a brush that is too wide.

day on postage for I had about 35 letters. Now I am sitting pretty good. 
Only received two to answer.
July 9, 1974:
In Iowa a man from Denver stopped to talk about Alaska and have 
me autograph his book … He made knives from power hack saw blades 
in his spare time. He gave me my choice of three that he had along. A 
chunk of elk antler for a handle and the blade secured in the handle 
with plastic steel. A good knife, thin and very sharp but that monster of 
a handle – too big and didn’t fit the hand. I wrapped the blade so I could 
hold it and went to work on it with a coarse half round rasp. Grip it and 
then rasp at the pressure points.
The gouge chisel even came into play. It fit when I was finished. A real 
form fit. Now for a few coats of satin finish Flecto when I do my spoons.
A couple sticks of spoon wood handy. A good job under the shelter 
of the woodshed. I had two finished before five.
March 30, 1975:
Search for suitable material to wrap a couple wedding gifts and a 
couple maps. People must think I am in a bind for wrapping paper. Old 
addresses and stamps on the inside and back it goes. Scraps of cardboard 
paper and string littered the place before I had finished. Walter Ward 
and his new wife Candance (that’s a new one) will be happy with that 
hippy type spoon and burl bowl.
April 1, 1975:
While working and scouting for good trees I came to one with a 
good burl. This one I would saw off and carve a bowl, some rainy day.
What an April fools day this was. I retired to the woodshed to 
round out my woodpile and saw a slab from the burl (too thick).
April 10, 1975: 
This afternoon I would rough out my burl bowl. Auger a bunch of 
holes with the big auger and then chop it out with the axe before going 
to the gouge chisel. I was doing fine until I hear something in the wood-
pile. I had seen tracks of Milo the ermine in the snow on the sawbuck 
and suspected it was he. It wasn’t long until he poked his head out here 
and then over there and that time he swapped ends to go back in and I 
saw his tail had lost its white and now a cream color.
April 14, 1975:
While I read I felt as if I should be doing some thing that would 
have to be done sooner or later. Carve the spoon for the warden’s wife. I 
doubt that he will be back until the ice is out but just in case he did come 
I would be prepared. My spoon wood a little scarce and buried under the 
snow. I found a stick for one and cut the end from a pole leaning in the

spruce for a second one. Right about then the first snow slide came down 
Falls mountain I ran to the beach to see if I could locate it. 
Back to work and for the rest of the day it was about equal time 
between woodwork and watching snow slides. I could hear them on all 
sides. Cowgill, Crag, Bell mountain, Allen, Falls, the rain was hasten-
ing the process.
While I was down on my knees chipping away I heard something 
behind me. Past me very close went a snowshoe rabbit and a second one 
that stopped not two feet from me and then raced on again. 
After the axe the gouge chisel and then the coarse rasp with a little 
help from the block plane. It rained a steady rain and water was running 
from the cabin roof eaves in streams. Some gouge work still to do on the 
burl bowl I had started several days ago. Every thing about ready for the 
sanding operation and I raked up my good pile of chips and put away 
my tools.
April 16, 1975:
This was going to be a stay at home day. A day to do my wood-
working chore. The two spoons and the burl bowl would use up most 
of the day. First the gouge chisel to remove as much wood as possible 
from the inside surfaces which are the most difficult to sand. Careful to 
keep those chips off of the clean floor. It snowed a good snow and as the 
temp. climbed it fell faster for it was nearing the rain stage. I used a lot 
of elbow grease and all the snips of sandpaper I had to get them close 
the final sanding. Noon and sandwich time and still I was rubbing away. 
I had them looking pretty good by two o’clock. The bowl still rough 
bark on the outside and round on the bottom. With the four foot one 
man saw I slabbed it off and the jackplane trued it for level. The coarse 
half round rasp to remove the bark careful not to get into the white 
wood. The snow had stopped about one so I could work at my bench 
that I had shoveled out yesterday. The temperature had climbed to 30°. 
A low ragged overcast of fog hid the peaks. A small repair to make on 
one spoon and the bowl to dry before more sanding.
May 3, 1975:
Tomorrow plane day so I had better get my outgoing mail in shape. 
I would box up my beautiful burl bowl and send it to Will Troyer and 
his wife in appreciation for the use of his fine Miller pan head.
July 30, 1975:
I had a small burl in the woodshed that would make a nice bowl 
so with gouge chisel I scooped it out and with half round coarse 
rasp I trimmed the bark down close. Burn in a few 
imperfections with a red-hot nail. Fill them with 
epoxy well loaded with brown spruce wood dust. 
If it turns out nice I will send it to State Trooper 
Dick’s custom handle for his 
coarse wood rasp.

Carl Fraser and his wife Marge for a wedding gift. He wrote, “I guess 
your book helped me come to Alaska two years ago.” Marge was book 
promotion manager for Alaska Northwest Pub. Co. at the time they 
met. She and her little son were on their way from Haines to Anchorage 
after riding the ferry. It was in winter and her car took to the ditch from 
the icy road near 40-mile roadhouse. Trooper Carl came to the rescue 
and they lived happily ever after.
June 23, 1976:
He shut her down and tourists began to pour out. John Ubanks, 
Chuck Hewett, and a couple more plus tall John Kauffmann. All of 
the Park Service. The pilot Tommy Belu who had been here before. He 
would have to go to Illiamna to gas up so blasted off into deep water and 
was gone. We came to the cabin and I stoked the fire for coffee.
Kauffmann had a gift for me from a friend of his in Maine. 
The man an outdoorsman, legislator, farmer, master of many 
crafts and lore. One morning while John was there he was work-
ing on a wooden ladle, using a crooked knife. This is a now rare 
knife used in Canada for canoe building and a variety of crafts. 
John thought of me and was telling his friend about me and Twin 
Lakes. The man said, “I have some crooked knife blades at home, 
bought long ago and I would like to have you give one to your 
friend”. So, there it was all wrapped and in a box. No handle, 
you make your own. The handle is made with a hollow for the 
thumb near the extreme end and you use it with the sharp edge 
towards you as you would a draw knife or spoke shave (only with 
one hand). The man’s name, William L. Vaughan. Elm Hill farm 
Hallowell, Maine. The blade very sharp and Sheffield speaks for 
the quality of the steel. I must write to the man and learn more 
about its use. 
Now, how was the film coming? Well, Brian Jones (the 
producer) Hubbard Blair (the sound man) Tom Grey (the 
camera man), Carl Dean (big wheel) and I had a good session 
at Harpers Ferry. We talked at length about your idea of the 
hikers coming to see you, finding the journals and reading from 
them. While we all recognize the idea was a good one, the 
Harpers Ferry Veterans pointed out that it is an approach that 
has been done many times before and introduces complications 
and contrived situations that are far less likely to make a top 
notch film than to have the narrative come straight from “the 
man involved”. 
So – we would like to proceed with our original idea of 
your providing whatever spoken commentary is desirable. Boy! right 
back where we left off at Harpers Ferry – the place I was really happy to 
see the last of. I find myself not looking forward to the coming of those

guys and their sneaky listening device. If it’s the same approach that 
they tried there, it’s a lot of garbage. Like the TV interview in Anch. I 
find myself not wanting to see it or even hear it (the film). 
“How long will this film run” I asked. “28 minutes” was John’s reply. 
“A four season film in 28 min, sounds pretty skimpy to me”. Oh he 
didn’t know maybe they would make it 48 minutes. So – they are due 
here July 14. A portable generator coming in soon to be used by them. 
Ubanks & Hewett coming through from Lake Clark soon too. 
More coming in July. Good thing that July is dead game wise or I would 
be loused up. 
They had coffee and the new ones took a tour of the timber trails. 
One came back and asked about the stumps sawed at two angles. It was 
my chopped stumps he was referring to. Guess he is a beaver chopper 
like most who come to the woods these days. 
The goose came back and I invited Tommy to inspect the good 
looking cub. He did and his comment “pretty nice, in fact just really 
nice”. He is a builder of home built airplanes. 
They climbed aboard and flew away. I put the canoe back in its 
resting place. 
Thinking about the sad turn of events, I sawed and split a length 
of wood, raked my beach and packed many tubs of coarse gravel to the 
down country side of the break water. 
By 1976 Dick had already filmed the building of his cabin and hand-
crafted furnishings along with wildlife and scenery. He was now working for 
the National Park Service taking more film of the wilderness around Twin 
Lakes. The National Park Service staff came to Twin Lakes to complete a 
documentary promoting a new national monument that would include Twin 
Lakes. Dick’s film “One Man’s Alaska” helped create Lake Clark National 
Monument. After a vote of Congress, President Jimmy Carter signed the leg-
islation to create Lake Clark National Park and Preserve in 1980.
I did not find any further journaling about the crooked knife.
August 6, 1976:
At least I have come up with a refillable ball point. My Scheaffer 
writes too heavy. My Parker doesn’t write half of the time. Ball points 
go dry one after the other. I have bottles and bottles (plastic now) of 
Quink. Ed Fortier had given me some (Bic’s) ball points. Long like a 
lead pencil. Clear plastic with a small tube of ink in a large full length 
cylinder. Pull the guts out and cut the ink tube off close to the point. 
Put it back together minus the tube. Fill the big tube with ink using a 
fountain pen for a filler. Bottle ink won’t feed through a ball point. Thin 
it, with what? Alcohol, from where? Hope’s cabin. Bob Emerson had left 
some Everclear 100 grain. It got some, thinned the ink, it worked. One 
filling would write all day, maybe two. So – I wrote letters nearly all 
afternoon. Light rain at times, a patch of blue but always wind.

Mary had been wanting a new sourdough spoon for a long time. She 
had sent her old one to Hawaii. Babe had said he would make her a nice 
one there. He also said if she left her bicycle here he would buy her a 
TV. No pattern so I hunted through the woodpile for a suitable stick of 
birch. Roughed it out with the axe and drew the design for her approval! 
Tending the beans, I would carve it out. A short spoon, bowl not too 
deep was the order. By three I had it finished except for final sanding.
July 4, 1977:
Back at the ranch I worked on my Parker pen. It broke and I sent it 
in and it broke again, same place. I have used it by dipping in the bottle 
but that is a pain. Now I have made a bending adjustment and maybe it 
will feed which it wouldn’t before. This Sheaffer uses entirely too much 
ink and ink is hard to come by.

Wet as sap but I had a project that needed doing and this would be 
a perfect day to do it. In my June 25th mail a graduation announcement 
from Kathy Yourkowski of Renton, Wash. Daughter of John Yourkoski, 
who I worked with on Kodiak. Graduation gifts are hard to come by in 
the wilderness. To get my self off the hook until I get to town I would 
find a nice spruce burl and carve her a bowl. A small one for trinkets. 
I pulled on my boots and rain gear. Took my little double bit axe and 
handsaw and crossed Hope Creek. I had seen some burls in the good 
spruce timber surrounded by the Cowgill willow thicket. It was wet 
enough but I was prepared for it. I poked around looking at all the dead 
trees but didn’t find what I wanted. I went up along the creek to the 
gorge and did no better. Back to this side and I went out behind Spike’s 
forty. I found some but not good or too large. I wandered down through 
Dick Weisser’s and inspected his cabin.
Along the path and near Hope’s cabin I know of a stump with a 
couple small burls but too small. Again I looked at them and then I 
noticed one low down on the backside. Just what I wanted. Good color 
and rough. With Flecto clear finish it would be a nice one. I proceeded to 
remove it. After all that tramping around in the wet brush here was one I 
had walked within two feet of thousand times. Learn something everyday. 
Back at the ranch I checked my rain gear and went to work with wood 
auger and gouge chisel. It was a tough little rascal with grain going forty 
ways. Couldn’t possibly carve it smooth. It would take a lot of sanding.
A hotcake sandwich and my birds fed I went at it again. Nice work-
ing in the wood shed, cool and no bugs. I was making better progress 
than I had expected. Thin enough and I was happy about that. Even 
though I had a leather glove over the end of the gouge, the palm of my 
right hand was telling me a blister wasn’t far away. Sanding it did take 
a lot of it and then there were imperfections, soft spots and hard spots.

I mixed up some clear epoxy glue and gave it a coat. When it hardens I 
will sand and give it another coat. 
My gift, the bowl, at the going wage these days, maybe $150.00. 
She would never guess but her dad will know.
July 14, 1977:
My expensive bowl was looking as if it was lined with glass. Now to 
get a good true flat surface for a bottom. A sheet of sandpaper on a glass 
plate did a real good job. I sanded the inside again and gave both a coat 
of epoxy.
July 15, 1977:
This morning after hotcakes I would take saw and axe and cut that 
high stump that I mutilated getting the burl. Cut them completely or 
leave them where they are located near a traveled trail. It was a tough 
one. Decay in the center and the 4' one man crosscut didn’t cut clean in 
rotten wood and so it drags heavier. By driving a wooden wedge in the 
cut behind the saw I made it. Locked it on my pack board and hauled it 
home. A few more burls to be removed but none worth the effort really. 
Better fire wood than anything.
July 26, 1977:
Two burls and neither struck me as being worth the effort. But, you 
never know. Really put some time in on a really rough one and it turns 
out to be the most attractive. The burl bowl graduation gift is a beautiful 
piece of wood. Brace and 5/16 drill bit to remove a lot of wood and make 
the gouge work easier. A stick of near iron hard spruce limb for a mallet. 
The block plane to form a flat base. It was 5:45 before I checked the 
time. An easy day, a light supper.
July 27, 1977:
I went to work on yesterdays burl bowl. True up the bottom to make 
it set level and then cut the inside as thin as I dared. I made pretty good 
progress with the very sharp gouge and in due time it was ready for a 
good dose of elbow grease and sandpaper. Pretty well done by noon … 
A little epoxy repair work on the bowl before I let it rest and be ready for 
final sanding.
August 5, 1977:
I presented Bella [Hammond] with that beautiful burl bowl. She had 
never seen one made of burl. Put on display with other gifts she has 
received it will be quite an attraction. Jay says Bella, you do alright when 
you come to Twin Lakes. She agreed.

with. Too small for a bowl but about right for a fancy paperweight if 
I loaded it with lead. How to load it with out making it noticeable. I 
scooped out a two-inch hole with the gouge and then from the same 
material made a close fitting two-inch shallow plug. With my side 
cutters I cut up some sinker lead tubing to fill the hollow. Sifted in some 
fine dry sand to fill the cavities. Mixed some sanding dust with the 
epoxy and glued the plug in place. When it dried I will trim the plug 
and sand the burl smooth. A couple coats of Flecto clear finish topside 
and bottom side and it will be done. The beauty of burl and the weight 
of lead, an unusual combination.
August 27, 1977:
Today one of my projects was to narrow the pen point still more and 
now I believe I have it. It was using ink as if it was going out of style. A 
bottle in about a month.
September 4, 1977:
Lunch past and I worked on my new burl bowl. The final gouge 
chisel work inside and the base cut and sanded. Top squared off. Next 
session will be the sanding inside.
September 9, 1977:
I would stay close and complete the burl bowl I had started. A final 
sanding and a few blemishes to erase with a hot wire. I was hard at it 
when here came a super cub on floats. He turned overhead and I recog-
nized the State’s paint job. It was Dave [Johnson] the warden.
Dave asked me if I planned to spend the winter here and I told him 
I was figuring on it. Good! He said and then added “I will have a good 
place to stop when over this way”. He brought up the subject of Carl 
and Marge Fraser. (I had made them a burl bowl for a wedding gift). 
Dave had noticed the bowl I was working on. Carl is now trooper at 
Dillingham and married again to a women he came near marrying 15 
years ago. A California woman and real nice. Carl had told him Marge 
took the one thing he wanted most, that bowl I had made.
They took off and me back to my woodwork. A few worm holes to 
make and it was ready for the Flecto clear finish.
September 10, 1977:
My hotcakes out of the way I got busy on my out going mail just in 
case Glen did show up. I had just finished when I heard a little airplane 
and operating at reduced power. He was making the landing approach 
straight in. I was at the beach to stop those precious floats from grinding 
on the gravel … At first I thought he was alone and then the passenger 
door opened and out climbed a strange woman. Blond straight hair she 
looked to be the outdoor type. He introduced her as Lael Morgan of 
Alaska Magazine. So this was the woman who takes the good pictures

from who knows where in Alaska and does a real good job of writing. 
She didn’t state her reason for being here but later I learned it was in 
connection with Alaska Geographic. Doing an issue on this area or 
some such deal. Glen says I brought everything but one – your mail. 
Didn’t think of it until we were well on the way here. No problem, I 
wouldn’t have any letters to answer. The birds came and put on their 
best performance. More business for Eastman Kodiak. We came in and 
had a cup of tea. Glen had taken Leon and Sig to the Bonanza Hills 
and they each got a caribou. Leon shot his at 80 yds. with Glen’s scope 
sighted 300. One shot, right though the eye. A nice bull, real good 
meat. Lael told of a couple of her experiences traveling. Getting five 
cups of tea from a tea bag and eating lots of pilot bread while walrus 
hunting with the Eskimos. She told of an old man she had met, 87 years 
old, and still very active. He takes vitamin C, feeling it is good for his 
arthritis. She told him she had heard vitamin C was good for romance. 
He screwed up his hearing aid a bit and ask her to repeat it. After a 
couple repeats she said, “I hear vitamin C helps you out with the girls”, 
“Oh! that is good to know in case I have to drop back to it”. Babe knew 
him and used to see his trap line snowshoe trails all over that part of the 
country. See him miles from camp, land and offer him a ride Oh no, I’ll 
walk and he would go treading on. 
I noticed she was busy with her notebook and Nikon 35 mm with 
flash. It didn’t bother my birds. Head for the door at the flash but come 
right back in. She asked me how many copies of the book had been sold 
and I said that quite some time ago the report was 50,000. She had 
heard a million. I told her the royalty checks didn’t indicate that many. 
I asked Glen when he was going to dig spuds and that I wanted to help. 
He didn’t know. It hadn’t frosted yet and he would like to leave them as 
long as he could. He would come get me and after the spuds were out I 
would go over to Miller Creek and John [Branson] and I would hike the 
trail to Twin Lakes. Glen would come and fly John back. 
My groceries, apples, bananas, banana bread, cheese, 25 lbs. of 
beans, new spuds, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, dill pickles, flour, onions 
– everything but mail. They were hardly out of sight when it started to 
rain. Sept. 8th Anch. Times with the loot so I took a once over lightly. 
No mail so I couldn’t declare this a Twin Lakes holiday. I would have 
to make it pay. I pulled on my rain gear and after dismantling the 
smoker, returned it to Hope’s cabin. Went on up and secured Spike’s 
cabin. Chimney down and capped, windows covered. Snow load props 
in place. 
Today before Glen and Lael flew away. She asked, “where is your 
outhouse, I want to explore the outhouse”. In a few minutes she came 
back and said, “I judge a man by the kind of outhouse he builds – you 
rate pretty high”. She inquired about the many ink bottles she saw stored 
there. “Is that where you do your writing?” Great sense of humor, that gal.

“Snow load props in place,” refers to the poles Dick put under the ridge 
pole and purlins of Spike’s cabin at the beginning of the winter to support 
the snow load. The log supporting the ridge pole in Spike’s cabin was in place 
when I arrived in 2000. It was left in place until I restored Spike’s and 
Hope’s cabin in 2001. The posts that support the bunkbeds I constructed in 
Spike’s and Hope’s cabins now give mid-span support to both the ridge pole 
and purlins in both cabins.
After using up all the ink, Dick washed every ink bottle, wrapped it with 
its original foam padding and put it in its box. Several of these bottles had 
items stored in them, including one with ash from Mount St. Helens’ 1980 
eruption.
October 1, 1977:
I got my out going mail ready. I wrote a bit while Glen licked the 
bunch closed. How was my postage account – “in the red”, he said. So 
I wrote a check for 26 dollars and some odd cents to buy two rolls of 
stamps. He had better go or be late for dinner. “I must operate by the 
cooks time”, he said.
October 13, 1977:
A couple packages to wrap for mailing. Two journals to go to Helen 
White and a sinker lead loaded little spruce burl paperweight to be sent

December 9, 1977:
Last evening I had to dig out another bottle of ink. 31⁄ 2 bottles  
I had used since June 10. How many miles of continuous inked line?  
I wish I knew.
December 20, 1977:
Last night my pen went on the fritz after I tried to break it from 
using so much ink. It refused to feed and I would have to shake it 
severely to get it started again. I took it apart and cleaned it good, too 
good for then it wouldn’t fill. We went round and round till 10 o’clock. 
I dug out a new Sheaffer Bicentennial no nonsense ball point cartridge 
pen. Red white and blue, big and clumsy. My name on it, but only two 
refills. They would last no time so – tonight I am using a Sheaffer Script 
bottle with the potent ink well and dipping the stubborn one left over 
from last night.
December 31, 1977:
At twelve I woke up to the fact that this would be hotcake morning 
and I hadn’t started my batter. I lit my old yellow flame and corrected 
that oversight and went back to bed. The batter in good shape for break-
fast at 7:15. 
A fair morning but it wasn’t to last till evening. As soon as breakfast 
dishes were done I got at my outgoing mail. I figured Glen would be in 
early. Caught up and I was writing a short letter to John Branson at Jay’s 
lodge when I thought I heard a plane. Here came the red T-craft sliding 
up the ice. 
Some spuds, eggs, chocolate mix, 50 qts. of dry milk and another 
item or two. Two big green mail sacks, which contained several pack-
ages along with my 36 letters and cards for this last day of the year… 
I got my mail and packages ready to go. Took them out to show 
them my neat water hole maintaining system. Glen allowed there is just 
about everything in the world and there has to be a long tapered plastic 
tube with the small end plugged. He would keep his eyes open for one. 
They climbed in and I pulled the prop. In a very few seconds I was alone 
with my load of civilization. Packages from sister Florence, brother 
Raymond and Robt. & wife. One from Spike and Hope and one from 
Lucy Benjamin and I knew what was in it. I had mentioned candles and 
she is a candle stick maker. A package from Porter’s Camera Store in 
Cedar Falls Iowa and that would be the new strobe light for my Exakta. 
A big brown padded envelope and in it the book “Island Between” by 
Margaret E. Murie, autographed and it read “To my good friend Dick 
Proenneke with every good wish” signed Mardy. The package that took 
first prize was one from bro. Robt. & Dorothy. A big box 14"x13" by 
10" high and packed full of every thing from canned goods to chewing 
gum and writing equip. Very heavy and I wish I had totaled the postage.

Glen’s mother-in-law had sent in a big foil covered plate of fancy sweet 
rolls. My three month old smoked caribou ribs and beans suddenly look 
very plain, but which would be better for the man climbing in knee deep 
snow. 
My cabin and cache have been full to over flowing for quite some 
time and each new load makes me wonder where I will stow it all. Till 
now every thing has found a place but the place is beginning to look 
cluttered. Perhaps the season of giving is past, I hope so. I do appreciate 
every thing but wish they would consider the poor miserable brush rat 
more fortunate than they and spend their money to beat death and taxes. 
Every box opened and every thing stowed before I got the cards and 
letters. All afternoon I read letters and cards and learned that several 
new states saw “One Man’s Wilderness” [“One Man’s Alaska,” produced by 
the National Park Service] on TV. I was surprised not to find a few threat-
ening letters in the bunch but this is the season to be jolly. Next plane 
will have some. 
One letter was a little extra special. It rated more than just a once 
over lightly the first time through. It was from the old sourdough Marty 
Murie. She had been to a Parks Suptr. Conference at Ester, Colorado. 
She wrote that they had a film evening and showed my film. “What an 
enchanting thing it is, I was so excited and moved to tears too”. As soon 
as she got home she called the naturalist at Grand Teton Ntl. Park. One 
of the staff would be hand carrying a copy back from Harper Ferry to 
Grand Teton. News, lots of news. Iowa and every where having weather 
such as they haven’t seen in a long time. Floods, snow, cold to below 
zero and suddenly up to 60 degrees. 
It was pretty dark when I opened and read the last one. I had bis-
cuits rising and I would have my own good garbage for supper, beans 
and caribou and sourdoughs … 
Entries like the one above are found throughout Dick’s journals, espe-
cially at Christmas. Letters, gifts and visits with family and friends kept 
Dick from feeling isolated or alone in his “One Man’s Wilderness.” 
Even if the process of filming “One Man’s Alaska” was frustrating for 
Dick, he certainly felt good about how the film was received.
January 22, 1978:
The day was about gone when I completed the job and remembered 
that my lantern fuel can was about empty. A refill at the woodshed and 
I found that my five gallon storage can was about half empty. What it 
costs for heat, light and water isn’t much. Garbage collection and phone 
bill is quite reasonable, but postage is something else. More than $50.00 
for six months.
Postage stamps were $.13 in 1978. Even if Dick mailed several boxes 
during those six months $50.00 represents a lot of correspondence.

May 6, 1978:
I asked him [Glen Alsworth Sr.] about postage money. I was sure 
that Pat [Patty Alsworth] had used all I had sent. He didn’t know and 
wouldn’t take any. He would put it on the book. I had 20 letters and a 
half dozen parcels to go.
June 1, 1978:
I got busy packing fifteen rolls of 16 mm and one of 35. More than 
$150.00 worth of film and lets hope it gets to its destination. I can 
insure it but money won’t buy what will be on it after processing. I wrote 
a couple letters and wrapped two journals no.’s 17 & 18. No. 19 will be 
ready before the 12 months is completed. More than three thousand 
written pages (6 x 9), 13,258 feet of line (about 21⁄ 2 miles) about six bot-
tles of ink. Miles traveled I wouldn’t know but could read the journals 
and come reasonably close.
June 3, 1978:
… “What’s new outside” [an Alaskan term meaning outside of Alaska], 
I ask him. “Postage has gone up to 15 cents” he replied. My 20 outgoing 
would cost me $3.00 or more. 15 rolls of 16 mm would be something else. 
This time he had everything I had ordered but my two packages of carrots.
July 10, 1978:
I was trudging along with my eyes on the moss and noticed a little 
long rectangular stone lying there. Strange that a natural stone should 
be so true and I picked it up. It was a knife sharpening stone lost by 
some hunters. Probably he had been sitting resting and sharpened his 
knife and laid the stone down. On through the pass and down the long 
grade towards the Kijik.
It was near twelve when we crossed the entrance to the big valley. 
Too much dwarf birch along the Kijik and the lower slope of the 
mountain facing the river so we would travel the north slope with solid 
footing and no brush – then climb over the mountain and down the 
same route that John [Branson], Craig [Corey], and Heidi [Hammond] had 
come up last summer. Trudging along and there lay a hunting knife. A 
Russell Belt Knife made in Canada. I was doing all right in the finding 
department. As we gained a little elevation after crossing the head of the 
big valley John spotted caribou back and to our right. Many caribou and 
we estimated their numbers to be more than a thousand.
July 16, 1978:
This afternoon I would see if I could make a new handle for the 
Russell belt knife I had found. The handle sides were hard wood riveted 
through the tang of the knife. Some varmint had chewed the handle a 
bit and split one side off. Had I looked when I picked it up I might have 
found it. The split edge looked fresh as if it had just separated. The new 
 327

one I would make of moose antler material. Tubular rivets, one half 
inside the other and they separated easy enough. With my meat saw I 
sawed two slabs of antler each having an outside surface. Sanded them 
flat and cut them to rough shape for outline. Stuck one on with Barge 
cement and then drilled in the tang for a guide. Then the other half on 
and drill from the opposite side. Supper time came too early to finish 
it so it sets curing in the biscuit rising reflector. Very good steel in the 
blade. A few strokes on the Gerber steel and it would shave my arm.
July 17, 1978:
I worked on my new knife handle. Moose antler many times better 
than wood. It works well with saw, rasp and file. A good sanding to finish 
it off. I wouldn’t trade the knife for new one with a hard wood handle.
August 19, 1978:
Glenda [Elliott], a very lady like person sat quietly and admired my 
view out the big window and door. I got my outgoing mail closed up and 
in the sack. I asked him how I stood on postage money in the post office. 
“Oh, we just stamp the stuff and add the cost to your grocery bill” he said. 
Ready to go, I asked Glenda if she would like to climb the ladder for 
a look in my cache. She did and I remembered my uncovered blueberries 
just inside the door. I asked her to hand me down a can which I would 
send home with them in payment for the coffee cake. 
August 29, 1978:
I would pick another half gallon of blueberries. Send Glenda 
another half gallon as past payment for the good sourdough pastry she 
sends each mail call. Again I wandered around near Old Timer country 
finding a good bunch of large ones here and there. It was noon when I 
came in with the cup full. 
December 22, 1978:
I wanted to see if I could build myself a postal scale so as to get some 
idea of what my postage expense should be. This old business of paying 
near triple first class rate on 4th class mail is no good. I searched for 
something with a certified net weight. A tiny box of raisins marked 1⁄2 
oz. net wt. but how close to 1⁄2 oz. was the actual weight? A larger size 
marked 11⁄2 oz. net weight. So I made a beam scale using some of Jim 
Shakes heavy wire. A strip of tin 15⁄8 wide to make a movable weight to 
slide along the beam. Trim the end of the 
strip until it equaled 1⁄2 oz. and then fold it 
3⁄4" wide cross wise to the far end, leaving a 
tab to drill a hole through and with a paper 
clip hang it on the beam. If “Sun Maid” 
didn’t fudge on the 1⁄2 oz. box of raisins I 
have an accurate scale and it looks like so …

For small packages, a box or two of oleo is a good scale of weight I 
think. Quarter lbs. out of the box and I’m thinking they are close. Use 
my heavy Mary Alsworth weather service yard stick for the balance 
beam. I’m sorta between the devil and the deep blue sea on this postage 
deal … What I need is a supply of stamps and a scale complete with 
postal rates. Since when is the post mistress required to lick stamps for 
thirty letters plus packages for one customer …
I never found Dick’s postal scale.
January 1, 1979:
Again Glenda sent me in a foil plate of sourdough sweet rolls and a 
bag of home made cookies. She is the greatest, that Glenda. Don’t like 
to send notes to Laddie’s wife so tell them to be real sure and thank her 
for me. 
April 4, 1979:
Today I would finish the ladle I had started two days ago. More 
gouge chisel work and then a heap of elbow grease and sandpaper. If it 
turned out real nice I would give it to Glenda in appreciation for all the 
sourdough pastry she has never failed to send. 
She is an artist with a brush I will let her finish it to suit her taste. 
White spruce takes a lot of sanding. Chisel and coarse rasp rips and 
tears much worse than when working with birch. I learned quite some 
time ago that sandpaper will last much longer in use if you cover the 
back side with masking tape or better still cloth backed adhesive or 
aluminum coated duct tape. 
April 5, 1979:
After chores and a close inspection of that ladle for the artist 
Glenda I decided that it needs more sanding and it took a lot of it for 
the epoxy had stained the wood and I wasn’t absolutely sure that a clear 
finish would match it – so – I sanded it down to clean wood. While I 
was in the business I finished the birch spoon and you can’t beat birch 
for beauty. White as bone and just as smooth. 
With nothing more important to do I took my little double bit axe 
to the woodshed and squared up the birch sticks for future use. Get 
them in shape to dry a bit before I start whittling. A couple small burls 
there too. One had been worked on last fall. Gouge chisel work of the 
toughest kind. Hold the burl steady with my left and push, not drive the 
gouge with my right.
With rare exception, the only birch growing around Twin Lakes is dwarf 
birch and Dick is probably referring to the larger Alaskan paper birch that 
grows at the lower elevation around Lake Clark. Dick found birch sticks that 
a camper left on the beach after flying their own firewood in to Twin Lakes. 
John Branson also gave Dick birch from Lake Clark to carve.

My arm and shoulder showing only a trace of soreness from the 
heavy gouge work so I gave them another go at it by continuing with the 
burl bowl.
April 10, 1979:
I sanded more on my burl bowl. Nearly good enough and now if 
I had some Flecto wood finish I would see if it was worth the elbow 
grease that went into carving & sanding.
April 14, 1979: 
From a poplar wood log I sawed, chopped and gouged out a holding 
device for holding spruce burls for hollowing. A wide notch with the end 
undercut to catch the lip of the burl and prevent it from tipping while I 
use the gouge.
April 20, 1979:
I wrote another letter and then after noon I would do a little sand-
ing. I was surprised that it went so well. Maybe fifteen minutes work 
to finish the burl bowl that I then wrapped for mailing to the lady in 
Juneau who sent me the ceramic mug.

We each packed a load of stuff and brought it all in one trip. A big 
sack of mail but it was because of packages. Some sourdough doughnuts 
from Glenda and a real nice note thanking me for the wooden ladle. 
When finished it will become a decoration in her kitchen of their new 
cabin when it is ready to live in. 
This ladle is stunningly beautiful! K. and I visited Glenda and Laddy at 
the end of our 2018 season at Twin Lakes. Glenda seemed delighted to show 
us Dick’s two ladles that frame her kitchen window. 
May 26, 1979:
It looked as if writing letters would ease my conscience more than 
anything I could do so I dug out another bottle of ink. When Lael 
Morgan of Alaska Northwest Pub. was here with Glen last year she 
spotted those empty ink bottles lined up on the nail tie in the outhouse 
and asked me if that was where I did my writing. Great sense of humor 
that Lael.
June 3, 1979:
Today Sunday and again I would write letters. Nearly $15.00 worth 
of stamps in these mail calls and more than fifteen figuring postage on 
parcels I sent to Port Alsworth to be stamped.
June 3, 1980:
Another project I have been thinking of. Make an Eskimo “Ulu” 
(woman’s knife). I have an old rusty worn out crosscut saw blade from 
Erv’s [Terry] dump. A length of axe handle (broken) to fashion the grip 
from. I would give it a whirl. To cut a length from the end of the saw 
blade I used a landing gear leg (broken) that I salvaged from Lofstedt’s 
180 [Cessna 180 aircraft] busted up in the brush at the upper end. 3⁄4 inch 
thick and sharp edges on the upper end. I laid my length mark on the 
sharp edge and hit it a few licks with the claw hammer to weaken the 
Another of Glenda Elliott’s birch ladles.

metal. Then mashed a line on the sharp edge. I weighted the saw blade 
down with the 8 lb. splitter head and hit the extending end a mighty 
blow. Broke like glass. I trimmed my rough ulu blade to shape the same 
way and then filed it to shape. Went pretty good but a file in good shape 
would have hastened the process. After getting it to shape I thinned 
and sharpened the cutting edge plus cleaning the rust off down to clean 
metal. The length of the grip, 41/8 inches. I sawed a saw cut lengthwise 
a half-inch deep. Now when I get it all dressed and polished I will epoxy 
the grip on. A thin blade and good steel, it should be a good one.
The gear leg makes a great anvil – heavy, broad and flat. I am sure Dick 
used this as an anvil even though I’ve not read it in his journals. I have used 
it many times with my work at his cabin. Dick left it on top of his 55-gallon 
food-storage drum with a rubber mat and piece of rubber snow machine track 
between it and the drum to dampen the sound when in use.
June 4, 1980:
I decided to fashion another ulu knife blade. This 
one larger and a point on one end. Seems a knife should 
have a point on the blade and it would be shaped thusly  
As near as possible I broke it to shape and then the filing, a lot of 
filing and then thinning the cutting edge until it will slice a potato as if it 
was boiled well done. And then scour the rust off.  
I doubted that it would be finished today 
but this evening found it laying on the 
window ledge ready for the hard wood grip.

June 5, 1980:
After a bite to eat I fashioned a guard to protect people who might 
get close to that razor sharp “ulu” knife. I plan to send it to some life-
long friends in Iowa. He is a collector of Indian relics and will enjoy the 
Eskimo ulu. Like a cemetery he will take anything.
June 6, 1980:
To finish the day I fashioned and installed the grip for my custom 
“ulu” knife. A king salmon splitting machine, that knife.
July 24, 1980:
I have been wanting to make a knife (hunting) from cross cut saw 
steel but how to cut a strip of saw steel 101⁄ 2" x 11⁄ 2". No chance of 
breaking out a chunk like that. How to cut it here in the wilderness 
was a challenge. I couldn’t pay up. A file will cut it if the file is in good 
shape. A good high quality hard saw blade might cut it slowly but would 
it last until the job was done. No frame for the blades of which I had 
two (one new one used) I would risk the used one. For a handle I used 
a six-inch length of dry spruce. Made a saw cut the length of it and 
nearly the width of the saw blade deep. Placed the blade in with two 
inches protruding – wrapped it with tape and I was ready to act like a 
jigsaw. About four inches an hour was the rate of travel and the three 
cuts totaled about 14 inches. I was on the last two inches of the hack saw 
blade when the blade came free and was ready for consider-
able filing to true up the edge profile and the back side. 
With a scythe stone I took the heavy coat of rust off 
and the light surf sloshing on the blade kept it 
clean. Birch will be the handle and held in 
place with epoxy.
… I finished the little birch sand-
wich spreader and I pronounced it 
the fanciest one I have ever seen. 
Shaped thusly concave on the face 
and convex on the back.
July 25, 1980:
Today I would make a handle for the knife but would switch from 
birch to moose antler for material. Antler is nice to work, cuts good with 
saw and rasp, no danger of splitting and it was dry where as the birch is 
soaking in the pond. I used the half round rasp to get the proper shape 
and then worked it down with file and sandpaper. Considerably less time 
to tell about it than it was to do. By noon I had it ready to saw the slot 
for the tang of the blade.
One lengthwise cut of the carpenters cut off saw made a slot just wide 
enough. I sawed for the tang to be inserted from the bottom side and 
sawed nearly to the top. The handle being form fitting the tang had to be 
 333
Gifts & Barter
shaped to fit the contour. Now, ready for the epoxy but first I will sharpen 
the cutting edge which will take some filing. Enough of tinkering.
July 26, 1980:
Dishes done and I went to work sharpening my new knife blade at 
the stump by the clothesline.
August 9, 1980:
Did more work on my saw blade steel, hunting knife. Glen saw it 
and said, “Say! There, is a knife and it fits my hand perfectly. How about 
making me one and I’ll pay you in flying time”? Hour for hour it would 
be a good deal. A year’s flights to Twin Lakes for a knife.
August 12, 1980:
I had the knife blade and handle ready to assemble so mixed up a 
little epoxy and made them one. That is going to be the cuttingest hunt-
ing knife that I have ever seen. A man could fight a bear and at least 
make it a draw match.
August 18, 1980:
I fished a few birch sticks out of my soaking pond and would 
chop out something. One stick had the proper curve for a spatula so 
I rounded one out for Linda to finish. I had given her the sandwich 
spreader I had made and Helen the batter-mixing spoon. One spoon left 
and I gave it to Florence for being such a good scout on the mountain 
climb. With a little Wesson oil she rubbed it to a beautiful finish.
These are three women Glen Alsworth flew to Twin Lakes. They spent a 
few days hiking with Dick.
September 13, 1980:
I have been thinking of making another ulu knife – a real small one 
this time. One with a cutting edge only 3 inches long around the curve 
point to point. The blade without the grip 2 inches high. If it turns out 
nice I will give it to Heidi Hammond in appreciation for the trouble the 
Gov. went to in getting my mail and grub order at Port Alsworth and 
flying it in.
So – I got out my good expensive hacksaw blade and sawed one out 
of saw blade steel. Now for a neat grip handle of bleached moose antler 
material. I have given a burl bowl and ladle to her mother and a burl 
paperweight to her dad. Heidi won’t feel slighted if she gets a souvenir too.
September 14, 1980:
Sunday and a wet one, a day to work on the little ulu knife. From 
rusty saw blade steel to polished metal takes a bit of doing in my big out 
door workshop. First a flat file edge wise until the rust is gone and then 
334 
	
Chapter 8
my oilstone to take the file marks out. Next emery cloth and oil to make 
it look like a factory job.
The blade was as bright as a new coin and tapered to a near cutting 
edge. Outback on a brush pile lay a badly porkypine gnawed moose 
antler. I would borrow a piece of it for the grip handle. I cut a piece 
21/8" long, 3⁄4" wide and 9/16" thick leaving the rough surface for the 
topside. Mortised out the socket for the blade, did a batch of sanding 
and filing and called it about right. Next I 
needed a guard to protect the sharp, to be, 
cutting edge and that too came from the 
antler. By 3:30 I had it ready to put together 
but that would wait until the antler parts get 
a couple coats of Varathane liquid gloss. The 
knife with guard in place looked thusly.
Among the things left in Dick’s woodshed is a piece of porcupine-gnawed 
moose antler. It is heavy, like stone, and the porcupine’s gnaw marks look like 
the cutting edges of a stone artifact. The porcupine likely gnawed on a piece of 
antler Dick had in his woodshed. Once Dick saw it looking as it does today, he 
kept it hidden away from further porcupine interest. I have enjoyed visitors 
holding this tactile artifact as they guess what it is.
September 16, 1980:
After dishes a little work to get the antler material ready to 
Varathane. A bit of sanding and Heidi’s initials to burn on the grip of 
the little ulu knife. My midget camp stove for a nice blue flame and a 
piece of wire for a branding iron. It looked pretty neat and I was happy 
about that. A slip of the hot iron is hard to erase.
September 26, 1980: 
Ester’s [Caporelli] sandwich spreader got a Wesson oil finish but due 
to no or very little dark heart wood showing it isn’t real attractive but 
Ester is a very practical woman and has much office work ... to do beside 
her home work.
I finished Heidi’s little ulu knife. Heidi with her round face and 
long black braids shows native and that part of her will appreciate the 
native woman’s knife.
The blade on Heidi’s little ulu knife, made from handsaw metal, is thin. 
Dick ground a wide radius bevel perfectly matching the curve of the blade on 
both sides. There is no secondary bevel. It’s a very fine filleting knife.
Dick crafted his gifts of spoons, bowls and knives to be used, but many 
have remained as unused treasured objects. I held Heidi’s ulu knife and Glenda 
Elliott’s spoon for as long as my visits lasted. I did not want to let go of either 
one, not because I wanted something Dick had made, but because my touch was 
mesmerized by their tactility.

November 13, 1980:
My knife I had started quite some time back [the hunting knife he 
started on July 24th] has been dead lined. I had epoxied the tang of the 
blade into the slot sawed in the moose horn handle. That would hold her 
I thought but was surprised when the slot in the handle spread and came 
loose from the blade. So – I took it off soaked it awhile and then wrapped 
it tight with nylon cord. There it laid and dried for weeks and a couple 
months. Drill the blade and put a couple rivets through handle and blade 
was my new idea. The blade could be sawed with an expensive hacksaw 
blade, a drill should drill it but I learned any drill that I have won’t touch 
it. Now, the slot in the handle pulled together and dried was so tight the 
only way I could get the blade in was to start the tip of the blade in the 
slot and drive it through with the hammer. Tight! Well I guess. This time 
I will try ‘Barge’ cement.
November 17, 1980:
The weather started to close in early and a few snowflakes came. I 
worked at completing my saw steel knife except for a little sanding on 
the moose antler handle.
November 18, 1980:
Breakfast over and cabin squared away I completed my good bear 
fighting knife. Only some sanding and sharpening to do and now it is 
ready for some Varathane when I am in the business.
November 26, 1980:
And from Heidi Hammond a letter thanking me for that beautiful 
little Ulu knife. “One more example of the beautiful creative things you 
do” was her comment. This fall she started work on a cabin of her own at 
Miller Creek.
December 3, 1980:
Today I would build a sheath for my “Grizzly fighter” hunting knife. 
I had no leather that I wanted to cut up so would try that good rubber 
coated nylon that I used for a neck strap on my binoculars and for the 
shoulder strap on the light pack frame. Very pliable at any temperature 
and very durable weather wise. So – I dug the big upholstery shears 
out of Spike’s ditty bag tool carrier and went to Hope’s cabin for the 
material.
For the next few hours I cut a pattern, traced, cut and sewed 
with my good L.L. Bean sewing awl using linen thread. It turned 
out to be completely satisfactory and I’m thinking Glen is going 
to want the knife more than ever. One time he said “you could 
live high on rolled oats for a long time for a knife like that”. It 
was complete but needed a little decoration on the very plain grey 
length of it. For now it hangs above the fireplace mantle.

December 25, 1980:
As I checked each box I put the contents back in and the card with 
it so as not to thank someone for someone else’s gift. Stacked them near 
the fireplace and the neatly folded wrapping paper on top. Now! where 
to store all the loot. Forgot a couple – a box of assorted fancy tea flavors 
from Glen and Pat and from Glenda and Laddy a painting of “One 
Man’s Wilderness” by Glenda. The scene – my cabin and cache with 
Crag mt. in the background just as it is on many slides I have taken from 
out on the lake. It is painted on a large 8" x 5" mushroom such as grows 
on birch trees. A beautiful thing and I will mail it to my sis Florence. 
She can put it on display with a large painting of the same scene at the 
Donnellson Library. 
December 29, 1980:
I gave the handle of my grizzly fighter knife another coat of 
Varathane and neatened up the sheath with epoxy and brown sanding 
dust. I think that I will give it to Glen. I know he would like to have it 
and I probably wouldn’t pack it anyway. I can make another one or one 
with a shorter blade for him and take this one back.
January 11, 1981:
Big deal! I am putting my new years resolution to work. The pen 
a Sheaffer cartridge fountain pen. A Christmas gift from my brother 
Robt. in Arlington Va. Two cartridges with it and none in captivity 
here. I wrote letters with one and learned that four good letters was the 
limit. .69¢ per cartridge it says on the bubble pack card. At that rate it 
costs nearly as much for envelope paper and ink as for postage. There 
had to be a better way so I came up with a little do-fumy to fill the 
empty cartridge from the bottle. 90 cents for a bottle of ink and one of 
these days I am going to run a test to see how many 69 cent cartridges a 
bottle will fill. At cartridge price there must be at least $30.00 worth of 
ink in a bottle. And I figure this pen uses about two thirds less ink than 
my old lifetime ink brush – big deal!
January 13, 1981:
Squared away I examined a Parker ink bottle. “Quink” they call 
it. Net contents 21⁄2 oz., price 69 cents – so – Anch. has jacked it to 
90 cents. With my very accurate letter scales I weighed the full ink 
cartridge (the second of the two that came with the pen). As close as 
I could tell the contents of eight would weigh about 1⁄2 oz. My god a 
mighty – ink for 40 cartridges at 69 cents each, in a 90 cent bottle. That 
comes out about 2.25 cents per cartridge, self service. 40 cartridges at 69 
cents each come to $27.60. Is it any wonder that fountain pens are a very 
scare item in stores these days. Now that I had the ink down to a rea-
sonable price I would write up a storm. I wrote until noon and beyond.

January 14, 1981:
Last night writing emptied my Sheaffer. Now, how many drops 
of ink to fill a cartridge? 55 by my count. How much would an empty 
cartridge weigh? As near as I could tell it equals that of paper match 
(small book). That isn’t much and I would say it would take 180 or 200 
to weigh 21⁄2 oz. So, the weight of the cartridge to hold a bottle of ink 
is .4 oz. Interesting but 55 drops of ink for 69 cents is ridiculous. I see 
where the ball point refill for Mary’s “No Nonsense” Sheaffer is .85. If 
the company isn’t making a reasonable profit I would suggest that they 
look for a bad leak in the bottom of the money sack.
January 17, 1981:
I gave Glen my good “grizzly fighter” knife and told him to use it 
and let me know where I could improve on another one. He had brought 
me a new $1.25 cent hacksaw blade to saw out a new blade. They 
climbed in and I flipped the prop. Sig the pilot and down the lake they 
went in a cloud of snow.
February 4, 1981:
Judging from the number of times I have refilled the ink cartridge 
for my Sheaffer I would fearlessly predict that at cartridge price I could 
use at least $75.00 worth of ink in a years time. I have weighed, as close 
as I can with my postal scale, 1⁄4 oz. of ink. Now I will keep record of 
the fillings from that amount. 21⁄2 oz. in one bottle.
February 28, 1981:
Today would be a day to open packages and digest my mail. My 
two robbers had come just after Bea and Hahns left and kept me busy 
yesterday and this morning. Two week old hotcakes still good due to 
the cold storage. My sourdough starter in good shape so I started bread 
sponge, got the cabin in order and opened my packages. From brother 
Robt. a batch of cartridge pens. Some that had been laying around and 
would never be used by him. Some of them Shaeffers like mine and 
one with a transparent barrel. That I like for I can see how the ink is 
holding out. I promptly switched that barrel to my point. And it also 
called it to my attention that ink cartridges come six in a pack for 69 
cents instead of one as I had thought. The ad I saw read ink cartridge 
69 cents but on close examination in very small print at the bottom 
six cartridges, sorry bout that. Even at six for .69 it is far from being a 
bargain. Just last evening I emptied my cartridge filler which had held 
1⁄4 oz. Four and one half or three quarters (closer) cartridges of ink. 12 
times that to make 21⁄2 oz. or one bottle of ink or 54 cartridges to the 
bottle. That makes ink $6.21 per bottle at the suggested selling price of 
69 cents per bottle. 
What I needed was a syringe to fill the cartridges. My sis Florence 
who works at the care center came up with two given to her by the 
338 
	
Chapter 8
nurse. One a 3 cc job and the other smaller. Use once and destroy it says 
in fine print. [These two syringes were in Dick’s gas-can box closet.] Perfect for 
the filling job. A few cookies in the box to fill the corners. 
June 8, 1981: 
My ex Chicago Sis wrote last mail call that her old buddy Maud in 
the Windy City wanted a wooden spoon from “One Man’s Wilderness” 
so bad and would be the happiest woman in the world if I made one 
especially for her. Would I some rainy day, carve out just a small one? I 
could at least rough one out while the weather was foul so I took my little 
double bit to the woodshed – selected a stick of Twin Lakes birch – got 
down on my knees at the chopping block and proceeded to hack one out.
Lunchtime came and went and the day continued foul so I got to 
the gouge chisel and rasping stage. Then a good session of sanding and 
it was looking ready for some Varathane. A pretty little thing with the 
brown heartwood of the stick showing from end to end. And, an order 
for a big peach and apple butter stirring paddle from a hometown lady 
who really likes to cook. A two-foot long paddle with a business end 
four inches wide – a good sturdy one that will reach to the bottom of 
a 20 qt. kettle. Something like a small canoe paddle. I have no stick 
of birch suitable but do have a discarded fireplace mantle of seasoned 
spruce. So – that will be the job for another rainy day.
June 9, 1981: 
Today would be a day to turn out that apple butter-stirring paddle 
so soon after breakfast I retired to the woodshed for some heavy sawing. 
Fred Cowgill’s one-man Swede saw is ideal for heavy ripping and I wish 
I had tried it when I built my cabin. I could have done a much more 
accurate and faster job. The paddle I would make two inches longer than 
specs called for. The shaft and grip I patterned after my good L.L. Bean 
canoe paddle. The seasoned spruce was perfect. Not a weather check, 
straight grain and only a few very small knots. For the first one it went 
real good and by lunchtime all it needed was a final good sanding and 
a coat of thinned Varathane. That old girl Ila will cackle when she sees 
that super peach and apple butter paddle.
June 18, 1981:
One package from the Tennessee boy Jeff Fortner … In that pack-
age just about the most beautiful hunting knife and sheath I have ever 
seen. Ten and one quarter inches over all and a blade of stainless 440-c 
steel. The handle is Rosewood Mocarta which he says is a man made 
wood and much more durable than wood. Made it himself and worked 
on it for two weeks. The sheath also looks professional and he wrote that 
a friend at work made it for him. Basket stamped, on the back, faintly 
USTO. Seems to me I have seen an advertisement for a knife kit of the 
 339
Gifts & Barter
same design. The blade a terrible thing being 3/16" thick on the back 
edge. I think Jeff is fishing for an invitation to Twin Lakes.
July 4, 1981:
By weight they are quite expensive and I hear postage is going to 20 
cents before long. U.S. has the lowest postage in the world and that isn’t fair.
July 14, 1981: 
In the woodshed I had the blank to another apple butter paddle 
waiting to be shaped and sanded, so after breakfast I took my tools and 
retired to the woodshed. First the axe and then the rasp followed by the 
“Stanley” surform scraper that is a good shaping tool. Made on the order 
of a kitchen grater. A very thin hard steel blade with hundreds of cutting 
edges – just the thing for knots. The paddle shaped up good and looks 
something like a miniature L.L. Bean canoe paddle.
September 12, 1981:
Something I have been thinking of making from cross cut saw steel 
to speed up my wood carving. A miniature drawknife. A little one with 
a blade about 31⁄2 inches long (cutting edge). Overall length about 61⁄2 
inches and width of blade 5⁄8 inch. Glen had given me a new “Simmons” 
high-speed steel hacksaw blade. It takes a real good one to cut saw 
steel. This job involved about nine inches of sawing and that fancy blade 
wasn’t quite up to that much. I had 
to finish with an old blade. Just a 
simple straight blade shaped thusly  
but it took lots of filing to get the 
beveled cutting edge.
Past eleven when I got my blade done.
Four o’clock when I arrived and just enough time to make and 
install the moose antler handles on my little jewel of a drawknife. Now 
it is complete – handles epoxied on. [I never found his drawknife.]
November 12, 1981:
Blowing down again and I wouldn’t paddle the lake. I had a heavy 
stick of birch and an order for a carving by Mark Lang for his pretty 
wife Sandy. The stick had a big weather check down one side but per-
haps I could cut it out. So – I made a lot of chips … A break for lunch 
and I went back to my chopping, gouging, rasping & smoothing with 
a rough cut file. My wood work was shaping up pretty good. The sun 
moved around to the 2:30 position and the ridge line of the mt. was very 
bright but I didn’t expect to see the sun there until 1982.
From November 12 until February 1, the sun does not clear the moun-
tain south of Dick’s cabin. His cabin is in the shade throughout the day for 
more than two months during the coldest time of the year.

November 14, 1981: 
I worked on the birch spoon again. The birch seasoned and hard. The 
bowl was taking an uncommon amount of sanding and I was thinking 
of a faster way to work those insides curves. If I had a tool that I could 
use with my hurdy gurdy hand drill. A 11⁄ 2 inch ball with a quarter inch 
shank to fit in the drill chuck. Cement some coarse 
sandpaper on 1⁄3 of the ball area and with the spoon 
held between my knees grind the inside from all angles. 
So, from a stick of stove wood I turned one out shaped 
thusly 
It made as much dust in five minutes as I could in a half hour 
grinding, twisting and pushing. Good but it wasn’t quite true – wobbled 
a bit. So I mounted [fastened] the [egg-beater] drill [with sanding knob] on 
a chunk [his saw sharpening clamp] and used my gouge chisel for a lathe 
tool. Trued it up perfectly. A dab of “barge” cement on both paper and 
ball – let it set five minutes – mash the paper on and it is there until you 
pull it off. All this engineering, producing and testing took considerable 
time and when I was ready for production I found it 2:45. 
I could still make the day pay and get some exercise if I grabbed my 
tools and paddled the mile and a quarter to the remainder of that good 
wood log on the beach across. Couldn’t see that distance due to fog but 
had little fear of becoming lost. The lake was calm as I paddled across. 
Three cuts made it chunks I could load in the canoe. A good load of bet-
ter than average wood. Ruffled water from an up lake breeze came as I 
paddled to my beach. 4:30 and 15°, the light failing fast. After my wood 
was taken care of and the canoe washed out and turned bottom up, I 
had my evening chores to do, water to fetch, wood to pack in, lantern to 
fill and a refill for my rolled oats jar.
November 16, 1981: 
Not a cold day to work in the woodshed. I had a seasoned poplar 
stick that I wanted to whittle on. Try out my new sanding device [sanding 
knob] as I had intended it to be used. With the stick roughly squared with 
the axe I would scoop out the bowl with the gouge. Then with the stick 
secured to my workbench log on the sawbuck I would sand the bowl with 
the hurdy gurdy drill. Then more axe work to rough out the spoon before 
using my miniature drawknife to get close to the final shape.
Dick’s “workbench log on the sawbuck” is what he usually referred to as 
his “holding device,” as seen on Page 329. Many visitors asked about this 
artifact’s use and I could not tell them definitively until I read Dick’s journals. 
This is a different workbench than the the one with four legs on Page 22.
When Dick writes, “ ... sand the bowl with the hurdy gurdy drill,” he is 
referring to using his “sanding knob” chucked in his egg-beater drill. I did not 
find his egg-beater drill or his sanding knob at his cabin. Dick’s “hurdy gurdy 
drill” is laying on the board under his cache on Page 171.

November 19, 1981: 
This afternoon just to streamline my methods I would carve another 
poplar spoon. Varathane on the first one made it a beautiful piece of 
wood. Same size 10 inches long and the bowl 2 inches wide. In two and 
one half hours I had it ready for the final sanding. In three hours I could 
have it ready for the Varathane.
December 1, 1981:
A couple years or more ago John Branson gave me a birch burl 
thinking I might want to carve a bowl from it. Started to once and 
found it pretty tough due to being dry. A couple days ago I noticed the 
thing for the umpteenth time and thought – how about soaking it in hot 
water for a day or two. So – I chucked it in my big 10-cup stew pot and 
applied the hot water. Left it on the stove day and night to tenderize. 
This morning I would give it a try with the gouge chisel. Soft, carved 
like green birch. I really scooped out the chips.
I scooped that burl right down to a thin shell before deciding to let 
it dry some and see what developed.
December 4, 1981:
 … more work on the birch bowl with the hurdy gurdy drill and 
sanding knob. Not satisfactory – too hard to hold between my knees. 
What I needed was a sturdy mounting for the drill standing at a 45° 
angle, business end up. Then I could hold and maneuver the bottom up 
bowl with one hand and crank the drill with the other. The sanding dust 
would fall free and not be plugging my sandpaper.
December 5, 1981:
After things were ship shape I dragged in my hand cranked sanding 
woodwork that I had turned out before dark last evening. A heavy two-
chunk length of wood with a flat side. I pulled the side handle, of wood, 
off of its metal peg and bored a hole in the chunk to take that metal 
peg. Gouged out a little recess for the drill handle to rest in — lashed 
the drill to the chunk and I was ready to sand up a storm. Worked well, 
much faster than hand sanding and uses less sandpaper.
December 13, 1981:
This afternoon I would see what I could do towards making my 
hurdy gurdy drill a better piece of equip. It takes two hands to operate 
the rig and some times three would be much better. Hold the work with 
one and drill with two. If I could get my head into the act it would free 
that third hand and forget I had it. What I had in mind was a cross 
head on the end of the round drill handle – something like the top end 
of a crutch but shorter and fatter. In my stockpile I found a chunk that 
looked about right. Six inches long, 2 and one quarter thick and 21⁄ 2 
Rotary rasping bit installed in Dick’s 
handcrafted wooden handle. Dick 
sometimes used a rotary rasp bit in his 
egg-beater drill.

inches deep. With the gouge chisel I cut a 11⁄ 2 inch deep socket in the 
center of one side. A socket to fit very tight on the end of the round han-
dle. Then I gave the stick a crescent shape with the socket on the outside 
of the curve. Force that socket on the end of the drill handle and tuck 
that crutch end between my chin and my chest. It works perfect and I 
claim that anyone who tries it and says otherwise is jealous because he 
didn’t think of it first. It should be in Brookstones catalogue of hard to 
find tools. 
I never found Dick’s chest support device for his “hurdy gurdy drill.”

Dishes done I cranked the hurdy gurdy to finish sanding the bowl 
of my latest creation. A great time saver that little rig and to think – the 
dozens I have sanded without it.
December 21, 1981:
Finally he set her down between my line of spruce boughs and the 
beach. It was Laddy and Mark again with Laddy as pilot. “Long time 
no see” was Mark’s greeting and he asked when they were here last. Two 
green mail sacks and one of them the large size for packages. A couple 
open boxes of foil and plastic bagged goodies from Port Alsworth. We 
had a load and Laddy followed with a box of spuds.
“My god amighty” the cabin floor was almost covered when the 
sacks were emptied. Later I would count about 80 cards and letters and 
a dozen packages (a few of which contained items I had ordered.)
Mark had ordered a spoon for his purty wife Sandy and so I gave him 
his choice of the two large ones but if Sandy didn’t get to Twin Lakes 
this summer (he had been talking of bringing her) the spoon would cost 
him $25.00. “How about a visit this winter?” So – Sandy will get to Twin 
Lakes as he has been promising her she would. The spoon he wanted in a 
sack so he could smuggle it in and wrap it for Christmas opening.
January 28, 1982:
It was planned that I would write letters today and I had better stick 
to it. Some could wait but thank you letters had better not be delayed 
too long. So – after things were squared away I placed my big hot rock 
on a cardboard under the table – kicked my boots off and with sock feet 
toasty warm I wrote with the top door open. Another ink bottle would 
be empty by evening and I wish I knew just what date I started using on 
it. I emptied it in record time I’m certain of that.

In my clean up campaign I ran across a newspaper. The “Old Timer”

If you had a bank that credited your account each morning with 
$86,400.00, carried over no balance from day to day, and allowed you to 
keep no cash in your account, and every evening canceled whatever part 
of the amount you had failed to use during the day, what would you do? 
Probably draw out every penny.
Well, you do have such a bank. Its name is “Time”. Every morn-
ing it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it rules off, as lost, 
whatever of this you have failed to invest to good purpose. It carries over 
no balance. It allowed no overdrafts. If you fail to use the day’s deposits, 
the loss is yours.
Dick sometimes started his daily journal entry with “reveille” at 4:30, 
5:00 or 6:00. He did not let the day slip away. A common misunderstanding 
of Dick’s life we heard from visitors was when they talked about him doing 
particular things “to keep from being bored” or because “all he had was time.” 
They did not understand the demanding life Dick chose to live. He had the 
same number of seconds to live each day as everyone else. He chose to live 
without many of the so-called time-saving conveniences that most of us have. 
Only a person of extraordinary energy and drive could have lived as fully as 
Dick lived.
February 15, 1982: 
My morning quota of seconds was used up doing small jobs. My 
urethaning to do and some repairs to make.
March 9, 1982:
To finish the day I wrote another letter and just about ran the bottle 
dry of ink. Just real close to two bottles of ink since I returned Dec. 17. 
25,000 words per 100 page journal. Maybe 10 journals per year plus 
letters. “My god a mighty” that’s a lot.
April 28, 1982:
I have been thinking of making a custom fish knife from cross cut 
saw steel. Glen, being in the fish guiding business should have a good 
one of a kind fish knife. A blade long and narrow to fillet fish. Teeth on 
the backside of the blade to scale grayling and a small spoon on the end 
of the handle to use in cleaning under the backbone. Slit it with the blade 
point and scrape the blood out with the spoon. Glen sometimes treats 
his fishermen to a trout baked in the coals of a campfire on the stream 
and they think it quite a treat. So – I would make the handle first and 
from a short piece of hickory axe handle. Mortise a socket and insert the 
tang of the blade. Epoxy would be the bonding agent. That very narrow 
deep mortise was the expensive one. Broke my hundred year old shoe 
cobblers sewing awl, and my 3⁄4" drill bit plus nearly setting the cabin a 
flame. To finish the mortise I would heat a piece of metal and burn it out. 
I would use my little blue flame midget camp stove. I didn’t put much

gas in the thing and that proved to be a good idea. To light it you sat-
urate a wick, light it and hold it under a copper coil that has the burner 
orifice. The copper coil transmits heat down into the tank that increases 
the pressure and forces the gas up to the burner. I applied the burning 
wick and it soon started to burn. I took the wick away and it sputtered 
out – air in the line I suspect. So I put a kitchen match to it not noticing 
that while I was getting the match, heat in the tank was forcing the gas 
out. First thing I knew I had a big fire and getting bigger by the second. 
Heat on the outside was building pressure on the inside and forcing gas 
out faster than it would burn at the burner. The thing was sitting on the 
drop leaf of the stove and flames got to my drying sleeping bag liner. I 
yanked it loose and away then grabbed a rag and smothered the inferno. 
After things cooled a bit I found that the tank was dry. Had it been full 
I would have had a handful to pitch out into the snow bank. All is well 
that ends well – I started out fresh and everything worked perfectly. I 
had the handle nearly ready for a blade by near noon.
April 29, 1982:
This morning I would cut on the blade for my custom knife. Try 
that new Remington Carbide cutting edge hacksaw blade that brother 
Jake had sent. Saw anything hard but nothing soft. Saw glass easily or 
a file or spring steel. Cross cut saw steel should be its cup of tea. First, 
I didn’t have a hacksaw frame for the blade but I had a meat saw with a 
14" frame. The hack saw blade 12 inches. So from a gallon peanut butter 
can top I made a link to extend the 12-inch blade. My saw blade mate-
rial leaning against the end of the woodshed and frozen in solid. A few 
whacks with a stick of stove wood got it free. I marked the outline and 
proceeded to saw. With an ordinary good hack saw blade it would take 
most of a half day to saw the approximately 10 inches I had to saw. Why 
that fool blade sawed like a 25 center as far as feel was concerned but 
it was cutting and I was surprised how fast it was cutting. The cutting 
edge is thick so no trouble to change course enough to follow a line or 
even a slight curve. I didn’t run a time check but suspect it took the 
better part of an hour and a half sawing time. After I finished I tried it 
on the neck of a vinegar bottle and it sawed so easy I looked to see if it 
Meat saw adapted to accept 12" hacksaw blades.

really was glass. Then a batch of filing to get all the proper curves. Rusty 
as sin and next will be to scour the rust off. Filing to put a cutting edge 
and taper to the point will take care of a lot of rust.
April 30, 1982:
My new knife blade was ready for the rough file and later a pocket 
stone and my diamond hone to erase the file marks. A couple hours of 
work had it ready to fit into the handle, but I have decided to do more 
work on the handle to give it more of the one of a kind look.
May 1, 1982:
On this side I reworked the new knife handle and now it suits me 
fine. Polished the blade more too and it is now ready for the grayling 
scaling teeth on the backside.
May 2, 1982:
Next my new knife handle got the flame treatment to give it some 
contrast. Then came the urethane and while I was at it some other carv-
ings got another coat.
Last evening saw my famous Sheaffer cartridge pen quit completely. 
It has been hitting and missing for sometime. Sheaffer says, “rinse the 
point in water now and again and it will give years of trouble free ser-
vice.” So I dunked it and splashed it around and that helped but trouble 
came more frequent as months passed. Last night it quit and nothing 
helped. Plugged up in the tip somewhere. So – I unlocked the fountain 
pen warehouse – Interruption – Now at eight and the sun low behind 
Falls mt. I heard swans and went out to see which way they were going. 
Directly overhead and up in the sun light was a beautiful wedge of maybe 
75 or 100 headed for the nesting grounds. They must have decided to 
wait no longer. I selected another cartridge pen. Now I would see what 
ailed the stubborn one so I pulled the point assembly out of the holder 
and took it apart. In the very narrow and thin channel that feeds ink to 
the tip was a collection of garbage that resembled a mouse nest of blue 
blotting paper. How did it get into my ink supply. A year or so ago I was 
dipping my old life time Sheaffer and I suspect that lint (paper) collecting 
on the tip when writing fell free in the bottle when I dipped the point. 
But I discontinued the use of that ink well Sheaffer bottle quite a long 
time ago. Anyway, I put the thing together and it worked perfectly. But, 
I had put another one in service and will let it rest awhile.
May 6, 1982:
My fancy fish knife not making much progress so I went to work on 
the blade. I filed the scaling teeth on the backside and then polished the 
entire blade with emery cloth and diesel fuel. The socket in the handle 
had shrunk with the several coats of Urethaning and I must risk burning 
the cabin down to enlarge the socket with red hot metal.

I needed some leather to fashion a sheath for my new fish knife but 
heavy leather is in small supply at Twin Lakes. I did have a lower leg 
skin from a moose that might serve the purpose. The hair short and 
silky. Fold it with skin side in. Soaked in warm water it would soon 
soften. Fold it and compress it between two gas can box boards until it 
dries. And go from there.
June 12, 1982:
And one from brother Jake containing among other things paint to 
dress up my gas can tin ware for the tourista season. Pat [Patty Alsworth] 
or Glenda [Elliott] has sent in a huge piece of cake wrapped in foil. 
I’m pretty fortunate to have Glen [Alsworth] taking care of my needs. 
Without him I wouldn’t have it so good or economical. 
June 19, 1982:
At last the details for the completion of my new knife sheath came 
to me and this morning I would complete the job. One of a kind and 
made from materials on hand. Jack Ross, the good log man, is a knife 
collector and I wish he could examine it and give his honest 
opinion. Glen might say as he did about the last one, which 
was, “Say, I would give you quite a bit of flying time for that.” 
Completed and with knife inserted I hung it over the fireplace 
mantle.
June 21, 1982:
Before noon I filed a good thin edge on my new knife blade and 
polished the file marks out with diamond hone, stone and emery cloth 
with oil. Now all it needs is imbedding in the handle with epoxy.
December 25, 1982: 
Partly Cloudy, Calm & 21°.
A real nice morning for that special day. A few nights ago I was 
reminded of Christmas. It was -6° calm and very frosty. By lantern light 
every bush and spruce sparkled – a million tiny candles winking on and 
off as I went to the woodshed … On the stump out front I had nailed a 
big strip of gut fat. I hollered for the birds and it was some minutes before 
they arrived… Boy oh boy! what a Christmas present. They would work 
like beavers – get tired and rest for a while and then back at it again. If I 
called them, they would quit and come to the door for hotcakes.
Everything in order I started to open parcels. Nine in all – excuse 
me – one in the cache makes it ten. Ten plus small gifts from Glen and 
Patty, Laddy & Glenda which turned out to be candy and cookies.
Before I got involved I remembered my little turkey bird in the 
cache. It would be frozen solid and I had better get it thawing …
Diamond hone.

What a batch of stuff – everything from soup to nuts. Two pack-
ages of Beef stick that is very good and will keep well into spring. Two 
gallons of chopped dried onions. I had ordered one and please write 
the price on the can so I could pay. Two came and as a gift. Any more I 
wanted I could pay for. Fruitcake, candy, nuts, a new Taylor thermom-
eter which is a nice one – a tube case with a clip so one can pack it to 
the mt. top. Dish towels and some material to cover my aluminum foil 
of the fireplace cover. I find the foil is of benefit in keeping the cabin 
warm. Heat is reflected back into the living area from it. The excess that 
I cut off stands against the wall behind my stool next to the stove. Sit 
there and I can feel the heat reflected from the foil. Items too numerous 
to mention. Even genuine imported Millet Spray bird feed for caged 
birds and wild birds. Be interesting to learn if I have any birds that will 
sample it.
Cinnamon drops and lemon drops, dish towels and pot holders and 
on and on. Nectarines a batch, semisweet chocolate, lentils and white 
beans and a note “Is there anything we can do for you?” And I suppose 
the next plane in will have more. I should hang out a sign “Twin Lakes 
general store.” With the flag flying my cabin has already been mistaken 
for a Post Office. I do appreciate everything and wish there was some 
way I could repay everyone for everything for I feel in debt. If only 
they had all gotten together and sent in a 25 lb. sack of rolled oats from 
“Nature Kitchen” I would have been “happy as a clam”. It would be eve-
ning before I pawed through boxes again and find Christmas wrapped 
gifts that I missed first time around. I hate to disturb the contents 
because I often end up with more than the box will hold when I try to 
put it back.
Everything neatly stacked in a corner, I did more work on my ice 
creepers. An uncommon amount of creeper ice this winter. Straps wear 
and heel claws need replacing.
March 18, 1983:
I had collected my mail at the post office and wanted to pay the 
Langs for the eggs that had been coming to Twin Lakes from their lay-
ing flock. Sandy wouldn’t take any payment so I must get even and plan 
to send out my oats which is not suitable for people eaten. They can feed 
it to their poultry.
May 3, 1983: 
Today I wanted to make another knife from cross cut saw steel. A 
51⁄4 inch blade 11⁄4 inches wide I have made two and gave them both 
to Glen. He likes those thin blades. Without much fuss or muss I sawed 
out the blade with my good Remington Carbide hacksaw blade. Using 
diesel fuel and a file I removed the rust. The handle I fashioned from axe 
handle wood (ash). It shaped up real good and now the blade is ready for 
a cutting edge.

May 4, 1983: 
I would complete my new knife this afternoon. It takes a heap of 
filing with a sharp file to shape a good cutting blade from good steel 
the thickness of a cross cut saw. After the filing the file marks have to 
be erased using a fine cut file and finally the “Eze Lap” diamond rod 
hone and the Brookstone flat diamond hone. I used diesel fuel with 
both to keep them clean and cutting good. At last the blade was done 
except for the final sharpening. The handle I would scorch with my little 
blue burner stove. That done I mixed up some five minute epoxy and 
fine birch sanding dust. Gave the mortise for the blade tang a generous 
amount and shoved the tang in the required amount. Mixed up more 
epoxy with magnetite (black sand) (iron) to finish filling around the 
blade and give the blade end of the handle a good black coat. In ten 
minutes I dressed it smooth with a file. Instead of urethane I would treat 
the handle with silicone. Two coats rubbed in and it looks good – light-
weight but heavy duty – I’ll call this model the “Grizzly Cub”.
May 12, 1983:
I wanted to make another knife. Make an airplane drivers knife 
and give it to Hollis [Twitchell].  Make one with a short blade and lots 
of curve. One that rides high and won’t be cutting the seat cushion in 
the cub. Little chance of that with a good sheath but a belt knife sheath 
usually rides too low when a man is sitting down. So, I sawed one out 
before lunch and this afternoon I shaped it, tapered it from cutting edge 
to back and rubbed the file marks out with the diamond hone.
May 13, 1983: 
This morning I would carve a handle for my new stubby knife. This 
handle would be heartwood of birch.
I sat on the sunny west side of the cabin and sanded the knife 
handle to perfection. That knife is turning out so good I am thinking of 
giving Hollis his choice of the two and hope he picks the first one.
May 14, 1983: 
Small chores was the order of the day when I got back from the check 
for lambs. Worked on my knife handle more. Used the little blue burner 
to give it some character and then with a finger rubbed on a coat of epoxy 
glue and tomorrow I will give it another coat to make it real durable. 
Darned a pair of sox, got cleaned up and put a washing on the line.
May 15, 1983:
After lunch I got involved in cleaning windows and some wood-
work plus my binoculars. Polished my new knife blade. Two coats of 
epoxy glue has given the handle more thickness of finish than a dozen of 
urethane.

After breakfast and chores done I gave the knife handle its final coat 
of epoxy.
May 18, 1983: 
I finally got back to my good new knife. The blade had been tapered 
from edge to back but left plenty dull until I got it set in the handle. 
A fine cut 10-inch flat file to thin the edge and taper it back a quarter 
inch, then my little 4" fine cut to erase the heavy file marks. Then the 
diamond hone to erase those marks – then the Gerber carbide steel to 
erase the diamond scratches. Finally emery cloth and diesel fuel to give 
it a satin finish. A buffing wheel would make it a mirror. Completed and 
shaving sharp.
July 1, 1983:
Late in the afternoon and late to start a letter I took my little axe to 
the woodshed and roughed out a sandwich spreader of birch. A gift for 
the purty ranger [Cheryl Bloethe] unless she is like Karen [Forsythe] and 
would rather do it herself. Easier said than done she found out. “You 
make it look so easy” she said after I took the axe and put a little muscle 
behind it.
July 11, 1983: 
It rained a light shower while I used the diamond rod hone on my 
little double bit axe in the woodshed. On the rusty crosscut saw blade I 
marked the design for another knife blade.
July 12, 1983:
A big cloud build up and it threatened to rain about noon and most 
of the afternoon. I had intended to go somewhere but it would have to 
be on land if I did. Cutting out and shaping a new knife blade seemed a 
more constructive idea. This one I would make for Hollis. Some one told 
him that he talked himself out of a good knife by saying the handle wasn’t 
long enough. It sure enough wasn’t – he has a large hand for a small man. 
So, I sawed, filed and used the diamond hone most of the afternoon.
July 13, 1983:
After lunch I looked for a piece of birch to make a knife handle. 
Found none good enough so started one of moose antler. Moose antler 
is very tough and heavy and makes a good handle when completed. I 
wanted to get a little exercise before the day was done so put my tools 
away and laced on my heavy hikers.
July 19, 1983:
I rested my back against the fireplace chimney while I mortised out 
the moose antler knife handle for Hollis’s knife.

Just got back and here came the blue and white 180 from Maine. 
George [Higgins] & Allison the man and married daughter … 
George in the head we crossed the skinny bridge and headed up the 
trail. Both of them fast walkers but I have traveled with fast walkers that 
soon slowed down. It wasn’t long until they took off a layer and his shirt 
was looking wet. At 1st canyon I took the lead and would hold it to the 
top and down the other side.
By the time we had completed the circle of the mt. they were begin-
ning to feel it but had done better than most. Here at the cabin George 
said that today was the highlight of their trip till now. Next they fly to 
Anch. and then on down the long road before swinging east toward lake 
Winnipeg and on to Maine. In two years he hoped to come again.
August 29, 1983: 
Expecting the boys down anytime and I didn’t dare leave so I would 
work on the hunting knife for Hollis. Moose antler handle and it needed 
to be worked down more in spite of him saying, “That’s just about right 
for my hand.” The blade needed more filing to get it thin at the cutting 
edge. The handle had been mortised for the blade tang and when I see 
need for more rasping I decided the time was now to epoxy the blade 
tang in the handle. For bedding material I added a generous amount of 
magnetite to the epoxy and filled the socket – pushed the tang in and 
cleaned off the excess. In place it looked like a too small blade in a too 
big handle but sorry bout that Hollis has a big hand.
August 30, 1983: 
Again after lunch I wrote to finish a letter and then turned to 
Hollis’s knife. Using the dark brown sanding dust from decayed spruce 
I colored and thickened some epoxy to form a cap on the rear end of the 
knife handle.
September 1, 1983:
They went and I got back to my “One Man’s Wilderness” living. 
Two more names in my guest book and I expect September weather will 
put a damper on the tourist business soon.
I wanted to work on Hollis’s knife handle this afternoon. I would 
need more fine brown wood dust to color the epoxy. Sandpaper would 
make it but sifting out all but the very fine was the problem. For 10-12 
years the screen from the generating system of a Coleman lantern had 
lay in a tin tray on my window ledge. Just right and I secured it to the 
outlet of my funnel. The handle would have brown (simulated) caps on 
each end of the handle to make it appear shorter. In due time it was 
hanging to dry over the stove. The knife something special. Tap the 
blade and it rings, like a bell.

Another session of work on the knife handle. Using epoxy and in 
different colors, so I must let each set before using more. Chimney soot 
is perfect for making black epoxy.
September 3, 1983: 
After dishes I had another session with the knife. Coated the han-
dles center section with tinted epoxy and hung it over the stove to cure.
September 4, 1983:
Morning work done I gave the knife handle the final coat of epoxy 
and placed it over the stove to dry.
September 6, 1983:
I was polishing the new knife blade out at the stump near the 
clothesline …
With the Brookstone diamond hone I gave the knife blade a good 
scouring to remove file marks. A final sharpening will make it complete.
January 7, 1984:
Marks wife Sandy sent me a good supply of apples, oranges and 
pears. Someone had sent them a box from Harry & David’s. So – this is 
your Xmas gift from us, Mark said.
May 25, 1984:
The ground was white within a short time. I sorted and burned a 
batch of old letters and content that I didn’t take the 4 foot Swede saw 
and go a mile and a quarter down the timber trail to saw a burl from 
a big dead spruce. It will make the bowl that Betty Alsworth paid for 
(denied it) with that large and very good fruitcake.
May 26, 1984:
This morning I would go saw the burl from the big dead tree. 
Good thing that I wore rain gear for the brush along the trail was wet. 
Caribou tracks since the snow and headed up country. Farther along I 
picked up a robin blue egg on the trail. Not just the shell and not broken 
that is strange. Poking along watching for dead trees and I found a burl 
before I got to the one I had in mind. Not just one burl but three (two 
small ones). So I used the axe and saw to remove them. Two not far 
from the trail and on a 4 foot snag so I chopped it off to make the job 
complete. I don’t like to mutilate the trees, dead or alive.
May 30, 1984: 
Time to think of Betty’s spruce burl bowl so I dug out my gouge 
chisel and started on it. Later going up the creek trail I spotted one I

liked better on a very old blow down tree stump. Not so large and less 
chips to remove. The lake ice turned snow white in the afternoon sun.
June 7, 1984:
Raining a good rain so after dishes I spread some papers on my table 
and got with the final sanding of the burl bowl. When finished it will 
be a pretty thing and if Betty asks me what she can make for me besides 
another fruitcake I will suggest a good heavy pair of knit gloves. Mary is 
the good glove knitter. They fit like a second skin. So, the sanding done 
I gave it a coat of urethane thinned with Jet fuel “B” and set it today on 
top of a bottom up wash pan on top of the stove.
Next came the knife I had started. The blade would measure 43/4" 
long and 9/16" wide. A slender tip with a point sharp as a needle. For a 
handle I used moose antler - part of the palm that the porkypines had 
worked on. The handle 7/8" wide, 1/2" thick and 4" long. I left the sides 
natural which is rough. I used the hurdy gurdy hand drill and 1/8" bit 
to mortise the handle for the tang of the blade. Bedded it with 5 min. 
epoxy and black sand. That quick epoxy is a quick way to get the job 
done. I had it completed and sharp by lunch time. For a finish on the 
handle I rubbed on a coat of epoxy with my finger. A real nice and very 
durable finish. Swedish bow saw steel – very thin and flexible. It will 
make a real good fish-filleting knife.
July 2, 1984: 
A good after noon for a project I had in mind. Last evening from 
cardboard I had made patterns for three knife blades of as many styles. 
A small belt knife with about a 4-inch blade is what I had in mind. I 
would make the handle of caribou antler – a scrap leftover from porcu-
pine days. So, from my crosscut saw steel supply I sawed one out with 
my carbide saw blade. Dressed it to shape with a rough-cut file. The 
handle came quick and easy. Drill nail holes in the wasted end of the 
antler. Nail it to a stump in an up right position. Drill the inlet for the 
blade tang with the hurdy gurdy drill. Shape the grip with a Japanese 
wood rasp. It was pretty well along by quitting time.
July 3, 1984:
This morning I would shape my knife blade so after breakfast I 
retired to the work shop under the spruce by the woodshed. I got it 
trimmed down to a near cutting edge and the rust removed. I came to 
the cabin for some thing and heard a big Cessna coming. White with 
dark blue trim – that would be Bee and Betty [Alsworth] and a chance to 
get my outgoing mail and a list out … Betty handed me a bag of cookies 
and one of red radishes. We came in and I handed her the package con-
taining the bowl. I had wrapped it intending to send it out next plane. 
“Oh! It’s wrapped so good I had better wait until I get home to open it,” 
 353
Gifts & Barter
she said. When I said, “no, open it if you want.” She tore paper like a 
little kid at Christmas time. “It’s beautiful, thank you so much” and she 
went on and on about it. Finally she said, “how’s your mittens holding 
out.” I ask her if she could knit gloves - good snug heavy ones. Yes she 
could – “on a piece of paper trace the outline of your hand and how long 
you want the cuffs.
Lunch a bit late and then back to the knife factory. I sawed the 
handle to length … got it ready for the blade and a coat of epoxy. Used 
my diamond rod hone and diesel fuel to remove the file marks from the 
blade. Stirred up a combination of epoxy and magnetite (black sand) to 
bed the blade tang in the mortise. A black cap on the end of the handle 
and let it rest for an hour … The epoxy set I stirred up another batch 
with a little saw dust mixed in to give it a darker hue. Rubbed on a coat 
with my forefinger and hung it to cure over night.
July 4, 1984:
My new knife was ready for the keen edge so I took a fine cut flat 
file to it before finishing with the diamond hone.
July 5, 1984: 
Breakfast and house cleaning out of the way I sawed and split a few 
to round out the pile. I had the fore leg skin of a moose soaking and 
would attempt to make a sheath for my new knife.
July 12, 1984: 
To form the sheath for my new belt knife I had chopped out an over 
size knife of wood. Soaked the moose leg skin until soft and then cut 
and sewed it for a loose fit. The dummy knife in place I let it dry and of 
course it shrunk tight. A bit of a wrestle to get the dummy out but my 
knife fit just pretty good. A belt loop of rawhide completed it.
Dick’s dummy knife is a carved wooden knife of the appropriate size and 
shape, wrapped with fiber packing tape.
September 2, 1984: 
This morning I would write a letter to get the day started. I had 
the scope trained on the Trask parties camp. I saw them assembled 
at their tent village on the hill. Next check saw them this side of the 
gravel banks traveling the open ridge. 15 I counted and that would be 
the entire party. On the trail but not for long. Next I saw of them they 
were walking the beach around Low Pass point. I made ready to pad-
dle down to meet them for I knew two or three would be pretty weary 
before they got here. The full crew so Sam the senior citizen lady would 
be along. Someone had a signal mirror for it was flashing as soon as they 
saw me coming. I don’t know how big it was but it was far more visible 
than an aircraft strobe light at that distance.

Chapter 8
I met them a quarter this side of Low Pass point and asked if 
there was any tail enders needing help. Sure enough, Sam was one and 
another lady. Bob Trask’s girlfriend. Mary would be bow paddle. We 
traveled slow so I could keep them on the trail for unless it is paved 
they will lose it soon. Twice I got them on and decided they couldn’t 
lose it. Looked back to see them on the rocks of the beach again. I 
delivered my load and went to Ervs landing for three more. While I 
was gone my robbers had come but the women didn’t know what to 
feed them. 
What a party – fifteen of them milling around taking pictures and 
I posed numerous times with various ones. Signed my name on many 
notepads to be glued in my book when they could get a copy. 
The cook had packed enough sandwich spread (homemade) for 
everyone and me too. She got down on her knees on the beach and put 
it all together. It was good and I fixed her up with a start of sour-
dough. She had bought a packet of dry starter but it didn’t smell nearly 
as good as this, she said. 
The lake was only slightly ruffled which was good. Those would 
have been some tired ones if they had to walk all the way back. 
I called for volunteers to go to the teetering rock and about nine 
wanted to go. One of them a Santa Rosa woman with her husband. I 
told them it was a fifteen minute walk. We climbed to 1st rock and took 
a break while some shot the cover view on the book and others picked 
and ate soft blueberries. On to the rock and it was quite an attraction. 
Some smart minds there and they figured the weight of the big chunk of 
granite. At least six tons and probably seven and to start it rocking with 
your thumb. Some could see and count as many as twenty four move-
ments before it stopped. 
While there Bob the leader asked everyone his or her age and 
what they did for a living. I was by far the oldest and goofen off was 
my trade. One or two were teachers. Some in the real estate business 
and dealing in condominiums. One was a video editor for the TV 
show “Hee Haw”. One was a teacher and a concert musician (piano). 
A couple in high technology. One the builder of split bamboo fly rods. 
A real nice bunch of people. We came to my cabin in fifteen minutes 
just like I said. There is a slight difference between climbing and long 
stepping down the mt. We arrived to find four girls asleep on the car-
pet and one reading a book. I dug out my guest book and what a nice 
collection of nice comments. That guest book is going to be interesting 
reading some day. 
Time to go and I told them to sort out the three most likely to be 
dragging on the far end. Sam was one. Mary Ann with the sore ankles 
was another. One with blisters and needing more skin was another. Bob 
Trask and his girlfriend Mary are due to be married soon and would 
like some little object from my gathering to remember “One Man’s 
 355
Gifts & Barter
Wilderness” by. Could have given them an Emerson Creek pet rock, but 
they had one from the Water fall trip. I decided to give them my conver-
sation shovel of Lake Clark birch. They were very pleased. 
March 21, 1985:
For this afternoon I had a project in mind. From bow saw blade I 
would make another kitchen knife. The blade 4 inches long and one 
half inch wide. The handle would be of caribou antler. The tempera-
ture was 36° and a good day to work in the woodshed. My second knife 
of that type and I think I will give it to Hollis’s, Pam Twitchell. She 
canned me a case of salmon and told me, “take it back with you.” She 
had worked hard canning and taking care of two little boys. I didn’t feel 
that I deserved the gift of a case. So next time I would take it if she still 
wanted me too. The knife will be a trading stock.
March 22, 1985:
My mail in order I put the finishing touches to the new knife han-
dle. I drilled a sizable hole near the end of the handle and chamfered 
both sides. Pam can hang it out of reach. Olin [Pam and Hollis’s son] is 
at the age of testing everything and this knife will be sharp. Gave the 
handle a coat of epoxy.
To finish the day I roughed out another knife handle from moose 
antler. A knife for my Sis – bet her knives are as dull as a hoe.
March 23, 1985: 
Pam’s knife needed to be finished. The blade sharpened and pol-
ished. I used my Brookstone diamond hone to make it a new bright 
steel blade and then very fine emery cloth and oil to polish it. By now it 
was most as sharp as a razor. With a folded paper towel between right 
thumb and fore finger I pulled the blade through to remove the oil. You 
guessed it right I cut my thumb and it took a good-sized band-aid to put 
me back on the duty line.
March 24, 1985: 
I worked at finishing my knife handles with epoxy.
March 25, 1985:
Pam would need a sheath for that very sharp kitchen knife so I set about 
to make one by using plastic L.L. Bean super tape and cloth backed adhe-
sive tape. It turned out pretty nice and I must make one for the 2nd knife.
I wrote a letter and then got busy on a blade for the second knife. 
With the carbide hack saw blade saw the teeth off of the broken bow 
saw blade and then knock a corner off to form the point. Lots of filing 
and honing stone. Didn’t expect to finish it today but by suppertime it 
was ready for the handle and the handle was ready for it.

March 26, 1985: 
… then got back into the knife business. I had epoxied the blade 
into the second handle last evening. So, I made a sheath and gave the 
blade the final sharpening and it is a sharp one.
March 27, 1985: 
This morning I would write another letter and after that I would 
use fine emory and very, very fine grit cloth with oil on the new knife 
blades. That took me to near noon.
April 19, 1985: 
As I suspected Hollis had my mail and I would find my completed 
tax return from my tax expert among the letters … Pam had sent six jars 
of home canned salmon plus oranges, bananas, apples, Hershey kiss’es 
and gum drops. “She sure likes that knife you made for her”, Hollis said 
and in my mail I would find a thank you note.
April 27, 1985: 
I had a short stub of bow saw blade left from knife making. I would 
make a letter opener of a sort and if it turned out presentable I might 
send it to Ginny Bessler, Park Service paper work artist.
July 14, 1985:
After the cabin was in order I got with my mail. A letter from Dr. 
George Higgins back in Maine. He and his daughter Caroline were due 
to visit Twin Lakes this year. He has flown in twice before and the last 
time in 83. He and his daughter Allison made the circle of the mt. tour 
with me. This time he wrote “It is with much sadness that I must tell you 
we won’t be able to visit your area this summer. My daughter Allison – 
the one that walked around your mountain – has developed leukemia – a 
fatal cancer of the blood. She still feels well and we have no idea how 
much longer she will continue to feel well, but I want to spend as much 
time with her as possible.” So, Dr. George won’t be coming this summer.
August 16, 1985: 
Fred [Hirschmann] wants a kitchen slicer like Pam’s.
August 19, 1985: 
They stayed all afternoon for in camp they would be damp and 
miserable. The girls jabbering up a storm and Craig [Craig and Wendy 
from New Hampshire] studying books. I went to the woodshed to saw 
and split a batch – came in and returned to the peace and quiet of the 
woodshed to rough out a knife handle for Fred’s kitchen knife.
August 20, 1985:
I worked on Fred’s knife – polished the blade and finished the handle.

August 21, 1985: 
This morning I had bedded the blade in Fred’s knife and now it was 
set to the stage that I could dress the epoxy magnetite combination to its 
proper shape.
December 20, 1985
Sandy had said, “Somebody had better go see Dick pretty quick for I 
am running out of space to stash his mail.” So, they [Hollis Twitchell and 
Andy Balluta] would play Santa Clause this afternoon. A big yellow mail 
sack and lots of parcels. We all had a load as we came to the cabin. The 
cub we had pushed to the bite of the beach out of the wind. 8 parcels 
and more than 60 letters and cards I counted later.
December 31, 1985:
Again I wrote letters while it tried to snow. The breeze was calming 
by noon. The last letters for 1985 and I wonder how many I have written 
and how many bottles of ink I have used. Checks for postage account 
with Sandy Lang $133.00. Ink maybe 5 bottles.
January 26, 1986:
It was pretty dark before I gave up and hauled old glory down and 
hung the cache ladder on the outside wall of the cabin. My nights wood 
in I called it a pretty good day. The temperature was not going down as 
it does if it is going to be a cool night. Too many clouds over head and 
the barometer falling a bit. 
Now at 9 o’clock partly cloudy, calm and -10°. A South Carolina 
stranger wrote, “I would love to touch your cabin and feel that I built it 
with my own hands.” 
March 14, 1986: 
It was a fine morning and lets not waste it. After breakfast and chores 
I did a bit of epoxy work on the knife handle and thought about the day.
March 16, 1986:
I sanded the Varathane job on the knife handle and gave it another 
coat along with a coat for my good snowshoes. 
March 18, 1986: 
After a bite I split a few chunks and then finished the blade sharp-
ening of Whitey’s [Merrick “Whitey” Rea Mohr] knife.
March 25, 1986: 
This morning I would install the blade in my latest knife. I had a 
few odds and ends of near used up epoxy so mixed up some 4-5 minute 
glue and added a generous portion of black sand. Didn’t fill the cavity

full for I wanted to finish with a light color. No problem and I had it set 
to cure. Epoxy holds Twin Lakes together.
March 26, 1986: 
Hotcakes and after chores done I turned my attention to the ques-
tionable knife blade bedding job. I found it just like it was when I put 
the blade in. How would I remove the gooey stuff? Some came out with 
the blade and I packed string in the socket and pulled it out. Finally a 
narrow strip of cloth until no more came out. I mixed a batch of Elmer’s 
2 hr. epoxy and added some black sand. I elevated it a bit over the stove 
and in one hr. I could file it.
I wrote another letter and Varathaned the knife-bedding job. It 
had been a chilly day with the breeze and about 9° the high. I wrapped 
“Whitey’s” knife for mailing and did my chores.
March 28, 1986: 
I did laundry, wrote letters and finished up the second knife. I will 
send this one to Wavel Wilkinson in Heppner Oregon. She is about 85 
and still very active. Drive her own car and pretty fast too. She probably 
whips up more short order meals than anyone I know. Always some of 
Shirley’s ranch crew passing by at mealtime. Often she is called on to 
babysit 3-4 cow dogs while Shirley [Wilkinson Rugg] goes some where 
for a few hours or a few days. She will appreciate a thin sharp knife.
April 10, 1986: 
I filed my caribou cutting bow saw and decided to cut out another 
knife blade from bow saw steel.
April 11, 1986: 
I completed the knife blade and carved a handle from the last 
remnant of that ratty looking caribou antler. Sanded it smooth and gave 
it a coat of varathane. While I worked at the wood shed on handle and 
blade my resident fox laid curled on the snow between wood shed and 
cabin. No more than ten feet from the pathway and still that fox would 
lay curled as I walked by.
April 12, 1986: 
Another coat of Varathane for my new knife handle and this knife 
will be a graceful thing if I do say so myself.
April 19, 1986:
First thing after the cabin was spic & span I bedded the knife blade 
in the new handle. It’s a pretty thing (my opinion). I had just finished 
when I heard a little airplane coming. It was the little Stinson and he 
landed coming down along the beach from Carrithers point. Glen and 
son Glenny.

May 1, 1986: 
Mail came for me and so I had to halt all outdoor work to get caught 
up. A letter from Whitey Mohr thanking me for the kitchen knife. He 
wrote, “I find myself wondering how I got along without one before 
now.” He likes that thin blade.
July 1, 1986:
I had the knife to work on so that was my easy job for today. It was 
shaping up pretty good and may be a popular item. Fred [Hirschmann] 
said yesterday, “you are known as the knife maker of Twin Lakes, at 
Port Alsworth.”
July 2, 1986: 
Getting close to July 4th so after chores I raked my beach, swept my 
pathways and gave the roof six buckets of water. I gave the new knife its 
final epoxy and renamed it the Miller Creek “Grizzly”.
After being given a broken stainless-steel Russell hunting knife while 
visiting Jay and Bella Hammond at their Miller Creek homestead on Lake 
Clark, Dick took a scrap of moose antler and fashioned a handle. He initially 
named the knife “The Miller Creek stubby.”
July 3, 1986:
I put the finishing touches to the Miller Creek “Grizzly” and gave it 
a coat of Varathane. It looks so nice.
July 4, 1986: 
This morning with the scope I saw it was the Cordova Twin Beech 
with Bill [McGee] as pilot and his daughter Katie as cook… I would pad-
dle down and see those friendly people from Cordova… I had about 3/4 
mile to go when the engines started and the Beech came slowly towards 
me. In close he stopped the engines, opened the hatch over his seat and 
stood waist high out of the cockpit. The rear door opened and Katie hol-
lered, “Hi Dick”. She climbed down on the float to grab the nose of the 
canoe as we drifted and visited … I must make that girl a kitchen knife.
July 6, 1986: 
This afternoon I would work at making a kitchen knife for Little 
Katie the Twin Beech cook in appreciation for the good groceries she 
gave me.
July 7, 1986: 
After chores I finished Katie’s knife and Varathaned the handles of three.
July 9, 1986:
Watered my roof and Varathaned my knife handles one more time.

August 23, 1986: 
A letter from St. Mary’s Episcopal Church, Anchorage, and it reads 
in part “As you are a respected and leading Alaskan author, we would be 
honored to include an item donated by you in our auction.” Blah, blah, 
blah. It reads exactly like the letter from the Providence hosp. aux. So, I 
cut out a kitchen knife blade and fashioned a handle from caribou antler.
August 24, 1986:
After lunch I worked on the new knife. Mortised out the socket in 
the handle for the blade and polished the blade.
August 26, 1986: 
Right away after chores I did more epoxy work on the kitchen knife. 
One more little bit of that good glue would complete the job when I put 
it over the stove to hasten the curing.
August 27, 1986: 
I completed and Varathaned the knife and later in the day I would 
give it a second coat. It will be ready for the auction September 1st but 
no airplane is expected before that date. Auction is September 24th.
August 30, 1986: 
I wasn’t happy with the Varathane job on my new knife handle. I 
had sanded it between coats and sanded through to the bare antler a few 
spots. No good! so I scraped it off and started fresh.
September 3, 1986: 
Except for cleaning up and honing a bit my donation knife was 
done so I completed it and would pack it for mailing. I would miss their 
September 1st request that it be there but it might not be too late to 
make the list of donations and those who sent them. I was wrapping 
it when I heard an outboard coming. Earlier on the radio I had heard 
Andy Balluta’s voice and suspected he was at the lower end. The rubber 
“Avon” raft came scooting in to the beach. It was Andy and it had been 
a long time since he was here. He is the translator of the native language 
to English.
So, Andy took my outgoing and the knife package.
September 13, 1986:
I asked Alison [Woodings, not to be confused with Dr. George Higgins’ 
daughter, Allison] to come back and we would circle the mt. She said 
“next year”. I said, “Don’t wait until you are old and crippled up”. She 
said “don’t worry, you will be dead and buried when I am still going 
strong.” “Don’t bet on that, Alison” I told her.

Someone in the front right seat and it was Alison who climbed out. 
She had her hiking boots on so she intended to circle the mt. with me. 
They unloaded groceries, her pack and a tent. Well now! that was a bit of 
a surprise. The fly boys climbed in and blasted off leaving me alone with 
the pretty girl. She said it was Hollis who talked her into coming – said 
he was going by this way and she would never have a better chance, so 
she got her gear together and came. Alison Woodings is her name and 
she told me later she is 24 yrs. old and tomorrow is her birthday.
September 16, 1986: 
Alison and I inspected my knife collection. Knives of all shapes and 
sizes. The last one was a very plain crosscut saw steel, hunting knife with 
a very plain axe handle wood handle. That one she liked better than any 
other, so I made her a present of it. We played more tapes of old time hits.
September 19, 1986: 
I had made a kitchen knife for Dave’s [Tyson] wife Debbie in appre-
ciation for the afghan she had knitted for me one winter while at home 
in Wisconsin. She thought the knife beautiful and doubted if she would 
use it much. She had a shelf back home that collects treasures from 
Alaska. She would like the knife on display.
November 14, 1986:
During the night I had spent considerable time thinking of a means 
to hang up Alisons fancy can opener. It has a 31/4 inch T handle which 
is shaped thusly 
Two plastic 
covered handles 
and I could drill 
a hole through 
one to hang it by, but the fool thing would hinge open like a pair of 
scissors hanging by one handle. So, I thought about a better way. The 
engineering department came up with a 
real good idea. Drill a quarter inch plus 
hole in one end of the T handle thusly 
Perfect, and now it hangs on the 1/4" 
wooden peg and replaces three of the “no workee” kind.

I had four letters to go and saw him off. In my mail a parcel from 
my good girl Alison. She had given it to Glen to deliver. Her letter

Alison Woodings’ knife. The handle

Lee [Fink] says “Hey Dick, Jay Hammond wants to know if it will 
be ok to come with his video crew the 14th or 15th of this month”. 
Lee is referring to the monthly television show, “Jay Hammond’s Alaska,” 
where Jay interviews a selection of unique and interesting Alaskans. This 
program would be about Dick Proenneke.
January 13, 1988:
We talked about Jay coming and how the program is carried out 
… I made a knife from a broken blade of a Russell green river hunting 
knife … I plan to present it to Jay as the “Miller Creek Grizzly” model 
from the “One Man’s Wilderness” knife works.
January 15, 1988: 
Finally they were ready to move to the woodshed for some sawing 
and splitting. Jay was in the scene visiting and asking questions as a 
neighbor would … We moved to the lake for some footage of Jay and I 
walking visiting complete with waving and pointing and finally it came 
to the closing scenes of us shaking hands and me presenting my “Miller 
creek Grizzly” homemade knife to him.
On the blade but mostly covered by the handle one can see “J.” for J. 
RUSSELL & CO. and “GRE” for GREEN RIVER WORKS.

It turned out to be Glen in a cub he had completely rebuilt.
I had him busy thinking about how much I owe him for plane 
service and grub since last May. He didn’t know and we would have to 
guess it. “How about 100.00 for grub and 150.00 for flying”. That was 
agreeable with me so we got even pretty quick.
He had brought me 3 doz. eggs and a couple cans of pop. Mark and 
Sandy had sent me in a care package two big oranges, a loaf of brown 
bread and some broccoli. So, he would go and I went out to pull the 
prop. and see him off.

I grow some thing on my cabin roof? I did plant a few seeds of spinach, 
collards and Swiss Chard up there.

Imagine 15 in a 12 x 16 cabin. It was truly wall to wall people. The 
first time that they had been in a warm room since they started. 
I dug out my albums to keep some occupied while I got tea water 
hot and used all my spare hotcakes to make little wedges to feed 15 just 
a little bit. A real good bunch and happy in spite of all the wet weather 
they have been through. It was about 4 their time when they started to 
think about heading back and decided on the same trail for the lake is 
higher and now stands at 36" above winter low. There would be no beach 
in places on the beach trail. 
August 4, 1989:
At the start it seemed that I was going as strong as in the past but 
everyone else was traveling at a faster pace. After about three miles I was 
having no trouble keeping with the pack and when it came to the last 
1000 feet I was in position to be first in the pass but I wanted to reserve 
that honor for Dr. George [Higgins] for his hike was in remembrance of 
his past daughter Allison who made the hike with he and I in 1983. The 
doctor remembered and said “I remember you letting Allison be first on 
the divide.” …
As we sat out of the breeze on the lee side the sun did shine on us a 
very few minutes and Dr. Geo. said it was Allison looking down …
Dr. Higgins returned to visit Dick many times, hiking the route Dick 
called, “circling the mt.” It is a strenuous hike but one Dick frequently took. 
Since his departure many visitors have started the hike but only a handful 
have gone over “the eye of the needle.”
Reaching any alpine pass at Twin Lakes is an achievement and looking 
over to the other side has the possibility of seeing a special wildlife sighting not 
to mention new vistas beyond. If I’m leading, I like to wait to allow everyone 
to look over a pass together but am surprised when someone walks over by 
themselves when they are leading. Dick lived his life at Twin Lakes wanting 
those with him to share those special moments.

Chapter 8
Dick’s “circling the mt.” starts by hiking up Hope Creek. Turn and follow 
the first tributary canyon to its headwater glacial cirque before ascending the 
progressively steepening scree to the pass Dick referred to as the “eye of the 
needle.” From there, slide or run 500' down deep loose scree to a magically 
beautiful canyon leading to Low Pass before descending to Twin Lakes and 
to his cabin. This is the same hike except in the opposite direction of Dick’s 
winter hike described in Chapter 2, when he rolled several hundred feet as he 
descended into the canyon from the “eye of the needle.”

Steve gripped my hand hard and said he had really appreciated the 
opportunity to come to “One Man’s Wilderness”. He had written in my

this has been the single most enjoyable experience of my life. Thanks 
again for everything.” honesty Steve Bairieau, Phillipston, Ma.
October 19, 1990:
First prepare a fresh batch of envelopes with my rubber stamp. Paint 
the trees green and the flag red, white and blue. 
My early letters from Dick were stamped with two men panning for gold 
along with a stamp of a bull moose or a big horn sheep. But after 1984, Dick 
stamped both the envelope and letterhead with the wilderness cabin stamp 
given to him by Fred Hirschmann. Each time he colored the trees green and 
the smoke raising from the chimney red. See the image on Page 431.
Dick’s letters are a study in communicating with an outward focus. Dick’s 
far-ranging statements and questions were his connections, his way of caring 
for those he wrote. The detail of his communications makes me think he was 
traveling in his mind to the many places his friends lived. It was his way of 
being with those with whom he was corresponding.

In my last mail a letter and card from Fairbanks. A 
picture of a pretty girl. The message on the card reads in 
part. Remember there is a young girl in Fairbanks who 
thinks of you highly and looks forward to seeing you 
again! and her name is Alison Woodings. She turned 25 
when she was here 5-6 years ago.
Dick made many spoons, ladles, bowls and knives while at 
Twin Lakes. Very few remained at his cabin when he departed. 
Dick gave these handcrafted items to special people he met and in 
exchange for things or services given to him.
Dick is known for his independence and self-sufficiency, and rightfully 
so, but that is only part of Dick’s relationship with the world beyond Twin 
Lakes. Dick had meaningful relationships with an extended multitude of 
family and friends. This chapter, regrettably, includes only a small collection 
of the people Dick thought highly of or included in his journals.
Glen Alsworth Jr. (Dick called him Glenny) once shared with me a few of 
his childhood memories of Dick Proenneke. Glen described Dick as a neighbor 
and friend. He said his grandpa and later his dad would bring things in for 
Dick or fly him places, and Dick would help harvest potatoes, repair equip-
ment and other things at Lake Clark. “We were all part of a community,” 
Glen said. “We looked after each other.”
Dick’s life at Twin Lakes is an inspiration for the individual freedom he 
demanded of himself while at the same time nurturing community. One only 
has to spend a few days meeting pilots and visitors at Dick’s cabin today to feel 
the sense of community that lives on within those who knew him.

Chapter 8
Theodore Karamanski asked Dick in a 1990 interview, “When you first 
came to Twin Lakes, did you have the intention of wanting to experiment in 
building the cabin or did you intend to be building a residence that you would 
live in for many years?” Dick responded, “No, it was just to be a cabin. I had 
seen and examined lots of cabins and I just wondered what kind of job I could 
do building a cabin on my own, you know, and just – and do it all the time 
too – no chain saw, just an axe and one of them bow saws, chisels and knots 
and whatever. I cut these logs in July [1967] … I received the bad news at 
Anchorage that it was closed to home sites [1968]. Then I was gonna drop it 
completely, then decided to put it together for pictures and make a movie of it. 
Which I did, and it was pretty popular. 
… I had a friend [Sam Keith] back east who worked up on Kodiak … He 
wanted to be a writer in the worst way. So I gave him the use of my journals 
… and so that’s how he wrote up this book, “One Man’s Wilderness.” In the 
meantime, BLM [Bureau of Land Management] had seen it [Dick’s cabin] and 
the resource manager said it would be a sacrilege to destroy it. And being as 
you acted in good faith, you can just continue to use it, you know. And so that’s 
what I’ve been doing. And then the book came out and they were so popular 
I thought that. People would think, “Well, if it’s so nice how come he’s not 
there?” And they asked that question and some of them did too. So that’s how 
come I got started and then my parents were still living at that time … so 
since 1983 I have only been to Anchorage one time.
At that time I talked it up, it was pretty nice, so I pretty near had to live 
up to my bragging, you know. So it got kind of catching and finally it got to 
be that this seemed like this was the place to be.”
Dick returned to Iowa each winter during his early years at Twin Lakes 
to spend time with his parents.
He journaled and filmed his experience like any of us might do when 
experiencing something new or interesting. But Dick took time out of his 
demanding days to document his entire experience. And his talents included 
envisioning an end product of a high-enough quality that it might be made 
into a film. Sections of Dick’s journals were published in the book, “One Man’s 
Wilderness,” in 1973, followed by the National Park Service using Dick’s film 
to produce, “One Man’s Alaska” in 1976. Once these reached a public audi-
ence, Dick’s early wishes for his experience had come true. The success of the 
book and film were an inspiration for Dick to continue living the life he had 
documented at Twin Lakes.

Living disconnected from a consumer lifestyle allowed Dick Proenneke the 
time to enjoy keeping his gear in usable condition. He believed in repairing 
rather than consuming.
July 20, 1967: 
A few odd jobs to do … Sew up the toe of my shoe. This makes 
three times I have repaired it. Casting line wore out in no time. This 
time I used 8 lb. test leader.
July 23, 1969:
After lunch I opened the cobbler shop. Three pairs of shoes and two 
needing sewing and some epoxy.  
June 17, 1970:
A misty rain took over which reminded me to give my leather shoes 
a good oiling. On returning to Port Alsworth I found my Eddie Bauer 
shoe pacs had returned from L. L. Beans in Free Port, Maine. New 
bottoms installed and a real nice job for $12.50.
I found three pairs of Dick’s boots with heavy wear and numerous repairs 
stored along with a new pair of winter boots in Weisser’s cabin. Dick also 
left a pair of winter boots with an average level of wear under his bunk bed. 
Dick was always prepared with a new pair of boots when the need arrived. 
Dick did not repair his boots because he had no money or because he had 
lived through the Great Depression and had a fear of not having enough. He 
made repairs because he believed in fully wearing something out before it was 
replaced.  
May 30, 1976:
After my spuds, my mail to read more thoroughly and then get a 
fresh kettle of beans on to cook. Repair my L.L. Bean pacs and it was 
good to know that I have a new pair in the cache.
May 1, 1981: 
I like Babe’s Japanese fleece lined 10-inch rubber pacs because they 
fit good and have a vibram type sole for good traction on the lake. Lace 
them no higher than the ankle and tie them off and I have no leg-chaf-
ing problem that Babe complained about. Age is getting to them and 
they cracked on the inside top side where they bend in walking. I got 
out my L.L. Bean stitching awl and good heavy linen thread. Perfect 
for outside to inside stitching. Did them both and gave them some G.E. 
silicone glass seal to make the repair watertight. Gave my good hikers a 
grease job while I was in the shoe department.

August 19, 1982:
Today I would go visit Mrs. owl again but not too early for the 
neighboring spruce would be shading the nest. So, I worked on my 
Canadian “Sorels”. Some stitching to replace a weak spot or two needed 
beefing up. A couple mitten liners to darn and I was ready to head down.
October 15, 1984: 
I wear my cow barn boots a lot when the weather is mild and snow 
not deep enough for snowshoes. Soles worn smooth they are not pre-
ferred but unlike vibram soles they don’t track in a lot of gravel. Sheet 
metal screws gave the traction but they snagged and pulled out or the 
heads wore off. I carved new tread with a sharp knife and that helped for 
a while. This time I would use Spikes little hand saw. Saw a crosshatch 
pattern on soles and heels. So I set them out to get cold and stiff. Seated 
on my stool out front I proceeded to saw new tread. Later I would find 
that they have real good traction, nearly as good as the vibrams.
October 18, 1986:
I had a few repairs to make on my LL Bean shoe pacs and a bit of 
sock darning to do while tending fire and water.
July 7, 1968:
Fog to the mountaintops and I slept in till 4:45 for a change. Today 
would be a day to take up the slack.
Last evening I put out a good sized laundry so there was mending to 
do and masking tape to replace on my carpenters overalls.
September 4, 1970:
A day for repairs – mend the broken knees in my old Frisco jeans. 
Too good to throw away and not good enough to keep.
September 16, 1974: 
I need a new pair of pants. The seat wearing out in my brush busters 
and for a while I wondered how come a guy that makes so many miles 
in a day wears the seat out of his pants. I came to the conclusion that it 
comes from sitting on rocks twisting and turning glassing the country. 
Babe had given me two pairs of new Black Bear brand Raintite (Oregon 
tin pants) pants. I had seen them in the cache this spring and back in 
the left hand corner I thought. I had worn one pair out and saved the 
second pair since 1968. I remembered he brought them while I was 
building the cabin. Some old guy had left them at his place years before.
In the cache I took a few items out – shifted some to the side and 
squeezed in. More shifting of boxes and finally I found them – brand 
new and only a few flies had crawled into the folds for the winter. The 
pants and a few other items out and the rest back in place. With my

big shears I cut them off but four inches longer than my brush busters, 
which were too high, trash went down into my sox.
It would have been the cut-off leg from one of these pairs of Raintite pants 
given to him by Babe Alsworth in 1968 that Dick used to make the tool case 
for his J-3 Cub in 1976. This tool case can be seen on Page 280.
June 8, 1976:
I used the last of my contact cement to mend my tin pants. Thread 
wears through on the side seams from going through the wire brush. A 
new pair on order from L.L. Bean.
November 7, 1980:
I was unemployed so I turned to the two cots that had been stand-
ing, folded, by the fireplace since I worked on them last. Some mending 
of the canvas to do and that seems to be the weak point of Army type 
canvas cots. Some one too heavy sits down too hard and rip goes the 
fabric. I worked until the light went out and time to think about wood, 
water and oil for my lamp.
We found one of these Army cots in Dick’s cache and several more in the 
cabins Dick used. They made a sturdy bed for guests and easily folded for stor-
age to about 8" square and 3' in length. Dick’s life at Twin Lakes reminds me 
of my childhood, surrounded with a multitude of surplus WWII gear includ-
ing several cots and almost every other WWII object Dick journaled about.
March 14, 1983:

three years or nine days less than three years to be exact. Folded neatly 
and in plastic, would they smell fresh as a daisy or not? I have some 
mothballs in the locker and they picked up just a trace. Looked pretty 
good, darn good I thought but I’m not too fussy. I spread the folded 
O.D. blanket on my table and used a damp cloth and my soap stone 
boot driers for pressing irons. Did pretty good and I hung them on a 
hanger from the ridge log.
Dick’s “O.D. blanket” was another WWII surplus item. It was referred 
to as an ‘OD blanket’ or ‘OD wool blanket’. OD stands for olive drab.
June 3, 1992: 
A real good pair of L.L. Bean pants but the tiny and delicate zipper. 
It failed and sewing in zippers by hand is not my cup of tea. I had some 
white “Velcro”. Easy to install and more reliable than a flimsy zipper so I 
spent some time gooping and sewing it in. Don’t know if I will like it a 
month from now but as of this evening I think it’s the greatest.
Glen Alsworth Sr. told a fun story about Dick and mending. Glen had 
flown to Turquoise Lake to pick up Dick and Will Troyer at the completion of 
a multiple-day caribou study. Will told Glen that Dick’s pants had split badly 
along the mid-seam and in May, camping was cold. At the end of the day, 
Dick excused himself and hiked to the shore of Turquoise Lake. In half an hour, 
Dick returned with his pants sewn. Not being able to contain himself, Will 
asked Dick how he had sewn his pants. Dick said he knew he could find some 
Soapstone boot driers. (Photo by Monroe Robinson)

fishing line along the shoreline – and he did. He then cut a triangle of metal 
from a tin can to fashion a needle and with that he sewed his pants.	
Dick not only repaired his boots but he also repaired his socks and gloves. 
He sewed cotton duck onto the palms of a pair of heavy wool mittens to extend 
their usable life. When he departed Twin Lakes, Dick left the mittens and 
darned socks in serviceable condition, ready for another winter’s use. He also 
left two pairs of never-worn, hand-knitted winter socks in his cache. They 
were most likely ones Mary Alsworth knitted for him.
October 1, 1974:
I worked at correcting my journals and did some darning on my 
heavy wool sox that Mary [Alsworth] had given me. These wore through 
directly under each heel and it’s a first for a failure at that point.
February 22, 1978:
My chores done, turn up the temperature of the water heater for a 
bath and laundry and then darn a hole in my good brindle colored sox. 
I wonder if Mary will forget how to knit those good five-year guaran-
tee sox now that she is in the land of the trade winds. [Babe and Mary 
Alsworth retired to Hawaii.]
November 22, 1978:
I messed around the cabin for a time – did some darning on my old 
G.I. heavy green sweater given to me by Spike and Hope. The underside 
of the sleeves more darned than not. A man should come to the wilder-
ness with a good supply of buckskin to armor sleeves from cuff to elbow.
November 10, 1981:
I had my breakfast and early morning shave with my Princess Grace 
hand cranked shaver. I needed a haircut too and would try a new system. 
Lather up good with warm water and Irish Spring soap. Then use my 
Penns easy trim. Perfect, in five minutes I had a Navy haircut and a 
good-looking one. The hair softened and very easy to cut. A blade will 
last twice as long. Water on to have a bath and do some laundry. Darn 
the heels of some good sox to save them from becoming Will Troyer 
specials. When his develops holes large enough to expose his entire heel 
he wears them with the hole on top until eventually the toe is separated 
from the top. His wife, Larce, is a school teacher and is a real estate 
agent licensed to sell in Alaska. It was noon before I got the red heel 
caps on, (used red yarn raveled from a worn out sock).
February 1, 1982:
Today would be a day for small jobs and more writing. The first 
of the three good Harley Waters wool shirts is beginning to wear thin 
where it gets the most wear. Some darning wool would give it a new lease

on life. My old plastic water bucket sprung an objectionable leak and I 
should bring down the metal one from Spike’s cabin. It’s a challenge of 
making things serviceable again that keeps me from burning them.
August 27, 1982:
I had water on to wash the felt liners for my Canadian Sorels. Damp 
and dried a hundred times during the winter – they could stand wash-
ing before I put them in storage. The wash water after the job was done 
indicated that I was correct. One of my super heavy sox by Mary needed 
some darning before it is retired for the summer.
January 19, 1983:
Had some darning to do on one of my L.L. Bean super mitts. Wool 
just doesn’t wear well when climbing aided by a staff.
April 29, 1984:
I finished the day darning sox. There is a relaxing job. And I snugged 
up the tops on a pair of wool sox with the elastic thread Sis Florence sent.
July 8, 1984:
I got busy repairing some boot sox of which I have plenty…
December 19, 1985:
They just don’t build them like they used to. My new L.L. Bean 
knickers sox showing thin at the back of the heels after no more than a 
few hundred miles. I needed a large size darning egg so went outside to 
my collection of pet rocks from Emerson Creek. Round and smooth, a 
dozen or more sizes to chose from. I put one on the stove to warm and 
dug out my beefing thread. “Coats & Clark” Luster Sheen knit and 
Crochet yarn 100% Breslon Acrylic fiber. That’s the best I could do and 
I know of nothing better. I have two pairs of 100% nylon boots sox from 
Kodiak days (50’s) that have thousands of miles on them and no holes. 
Not tall enough to suit me.
May 10, 1986:
Some time not so long ago I hung my good L.L. Bean knickers rag-
wool sox on the hooks behind the stovepipe. The toes must have been 
touching the pipe when I built up the fire in the morning for I found 
them brown. In due time a hole appeared in one. I did a darning job and 
this morning found the other one needing it too. So, I took a welcome 
break from writing and closed up the hole.
August 26, 1991: 
Last night was the first I have used the gas lantern this summer. To 
early to climb the ladder so I would see what I could do about making 
my “Wear Guard” Jeep cap fit properly, until now no lasting success.

Elastic thread didn’t last. Boiling didn’t shrink it and the tag says 100% 
wool. I doubt very much that it is wool.
This time I threaded my big darning needle with one strand of 
heavy acrylic yarn – started at headband position inside in front. Hide 
the yarn in the thick material as I went full circle. Snugged it up and 
put it on to expand it to the proper fit. The two ends outside under the 
turned up band. I tied a bowknot there – tried it on and gave it a final 
adjustment. Perfect! And if it needs adjusting, do it! I have a couple 
more Jeep caps needing the same improvement.
A few years ago I gave a tour of Dick’s cabin to a group of hikers in their 
30s from Romania. Some now live in the United States. When I showed them 
a pair of heavily darned socks, the room filled with something fun being spo-
ken in Romanian. They were the first visitors to show interest and appreciate 
Dick’s clothing repairs and sock darning. They had all grown up darning socks 
in their home country but said it was not commonly done in Romania today. 
Everyone had stories including using a light bulb inside the sock where Dick 
had used a “pet rock from Emerson Creek.” This was a fun conversation since 
I too grew up darning holes in my socks. 
August 2, 1968:
I went to sleep last night listening to the waves lapping against the 
beach and the sound of Hope Creek never ending until freeze up.
Last evening I lit the lantern for the first time this summer and took 
some pictures inside the cabin. Using the wide-angle 35 mm Schneider 
lens. This morning I brought the Kamplite gas lantern down from the 
main cabin. It was on the fritz last summer. I proceeded to dismantle 
that jasper and soon found the trouble. About a teaspoon full of black 
sludge in the tank which had plugged the outlet screen and hole in the 
outlet tube. I rinsed the tank many times and finally it came clean. It 
works perfectly now. Tonight I plan to use two gas lights and my bright 
gas can dish pan for reflectors and use a chrome blue filter with my 40 
mm wide angle and see which are the best. I must have some good shots 
inside this diggins.
This lantern is probably one the Carrithers brought to Twin Lakes. It was 
manufactured by the American Gas Machine Co. The Kamplite name was used 
from around 1949 to 1960. This lantern continued to be manufactured for Sears 
Canada until around 1961 or 1962 for the J.C. Higgins line. The pump, filler 
cap and much more seem identical to Coleman brand gas lanterns, but this one 
will illuminate a tabletop as it safely sits on the table. Dick’s Kamplite still 
works. Dick sometimes called it his “upside down lantern.”
November 7, 1968:
My lantern had been acting up. The generator plugged with carbon 
no doubt. I took it off and found the cleaning rod stuck tight. Some lac-
quer thinner fixed that. I got it out and cleaned it up. Put it back together

and attempted to light it. No go I took it apart and found the cleaning 
wire collapsed beyond repair. A hard chunk of carbon had plugged the 
hole I suppose. Back to the old reliable Kamplite and I must repair the 
tip cleaner somehow. No telling when I can get a replacement generator.
November 8, 1968:
Very poor visibility, a day to tinker with the lantern and saw a few 
sticks of wood. The tip cleaner in the generator I cut the stem back a 
quarter inch to expose more cleaning wire – then cut the stem in two 
and lengthened it to give it the proper over all length. Put it together 
and it plugged the first attempt. And the wire folded and broke on 
trying to clear it. Maybe I could make it work without the tip cleaner. 
It plugged as soon as I opened the valve. Clean it and try again – same 
result. I soaked it in lacquer thinner that helped. I boiled it on the stove 
and that helped. I gave it the thinner treatment again. Put it together 
and lit it and it has been working like a new one for an hr. and a half. If 
it plugs I will soak it again. In all the monkey wrenchen so close to the 
delicate mantle I nicked it, so went up to the cabin and found two and I 
am sure there are more.
November 9, 1968:
This morning I would be really sharp. Took the generator off of the 
lantern and put it to soak for the day. I should have left it alone. I spent 
hrs. soaking and boiling and rinsing and blowing before I got it to work 
again. Just after sunset it took off and then plugged again and I cleaned 
some more. The mantle has a hole next to the generator which makes it 
too hot I think. It dims and I must shut it off until it is nearly out then it 
will burn bright again. Lucky I have the old Kamplite as a stand by.
December 2, 1968:  
And a -22°. 
I sat in the dark awhile last night and looked out on the moonlit lake. 
My Coleman had plugged and the globe gave out on the Kamplite. My 
candles had burned low so I put them out. It was getting colder by the 
minute and I wondered how I would fare if caught out in severe weather. 
Get into the thick timber and build a big fire or even two of them.

My cow barn lantern to solder with epoxy. Greens to gather for 
supper. It had been a busy day.
September 19, 1976:
The little Coleman fueled and it works like a new one. I had 
installed a new generator a few days ago. Coleman pressure appliance 
fuel is $2.35 per gal. in Anchorage. I must get five [five-gallon gas can] of 
Blazo from Babe next trip in.

January 14, 1979: 
To use up the morning, dismantle my old cow barn lantern. The 
spring-loaded tube that rests on top of the globe was badly rusted out. 
That could be part of my over heating problem. Heat escaping through 
the large rusted out area could be recycled back to the burner by way of 
the side tubes. Some time back I had covered the foil when the flame 
appeared more yellow. The big tube easier to fix than I anticipated. 
Remove the big coil spring and replace it after wrapping the tube with 
thin aluminum of a 7 up soft drink can. Aluminum is the best material. 
Industry builds an automobile that will rust out in three years and a beer 
can that will last 3000 years. And I replaced the rusted out cap with 
eight-inch square mesh wire to let the heat escape with no restriction. 
Back together I lit her off and got no kick back so I hung it over the 
stove as a severe test. That did it. In a short while the flame began to 
enlarge. I snuffed her out and hung her under the over hang. It was past 
noontime and a pretty day.
November 27, 1981: 
Getting dark and snowing again as I put the bread in the tater baker 
oven. Plenty of water so I wouldn’t get more. My wood supply for the 
night I closed the door and lit the cow barn lantern. I like it much better 
than the Aladdin. Burns maybe one fourth as much fuel. No mantle or 
cracking chimney problems. No noticeable heat and by sitting a half cir-
cle of foil behind it gives plenty of light for one person to read or write. 
In Juneau $85.00 for a cord of wood (chunks quartered). $45.00 per hr. 
for an electrician to hook up a light. At T.L.’s utilities are reasonable.
November 6, 1968:
Another day for small jobs and gathering wood. My saw set has 
never performed like I thought it should so I took it apart and worked it 
over. That required that I set and file my saws. A very few flakes of snow 
fell while I worked out at my bench. After lunch the temp. 42° and the 
snow in the timber got soft and wet for the first time. I could see that it 
was snowing on the mountains from Glacier creek on up country. Four 
trees cut and packed in and some sawed and split. My woodshed is as 
full as I care to have it. More would cut down my workspace.
July 12, 1976:
Now I had that bundle of 40 saw blades waiting to be set and filed. 
In the bunch I found three broken ones. Just what I needed for my short 
bow saw. Break them off at the right length. Stick the end in the stove 
and bury it in a can of ashes when it was red. No problem to drill a hole 
in the end after the temper was destroyed. I sat on the beach and set the 
teeth on eight, filed them and then eight more. When I finish Babe will 
run out of lifetime before he runs short of sharp saw blades.

April 25, 1981: 
Glen began to hand out the cargo. Mail sack and my grocery order 
and then tools, lots of tools. Two single bit boys size axes, a hand axe. 
A sledge with a much tapered handle. A man size single bit with the 
handle broken off near the head. A mattock head and handle. Handles 
for the sledge and big axe. A rip saw, crosscut hand saw and keyhole saw. 
Enough tools to start a second hand store. All from the Mission Girls. 
Their tools that needed new handles put in and everything sharpened. 
Then out came a big stainless tray 11" x 17" in a shopping sack. A thin 
chocolate cake with frosting half as thick as the cake. A canned ham 
and candy. A tape recorder and player and a tape (religious of course).
December 15, 1985: 
Yesterday while bucking the blow down [blown down tree] I decided 
my saw could stand some set and sharpening so after breakfast chores I 
gave both my bow saws the treatment. Freddy the squirrel is a tame one 
and came within a couple feet to inspect the operation.
April 12, 1989: 
Yesterday I had shoveled snow to get to my saw filing clamp chunk. 
A long chunk on three legs. A saw cut length wise to take the saw 
blade with teeth protruding up. A saw cut in the side in which I drive a 
caulking iron to close the cut holding the saw. Quite a few people have 
examined that tool and couldn’t come up with a use for it. It is heavy 
and solid and a file cuts better if the saw blade is clamped tight … On

the beach I set and filed three saw blades. When John Branson was 
quitting Alaska for good he gave me a batch of stuff and a saw was part 
of it. Now that he is going to build at Port Alsworth I will give him his 
past belongings.
Growing up in Nondalton, Alaska, where saw sharpening was done by 
hand, George Alexie understood Dick’s use of the “saw filing clamp” immedi-
ately when he saw it in 2000 under a spruce tree near Dick’s woodshed. 
Just like Dick, K. and I enjoy asking visitors to imagine Dick’s use for 
the clamp, sometimes giving them a hint by leaning the Sandvikens No. 241 
against the clamp. 
Babe Alsworth, his son Glen, and other pilots would arrive from Port 
Alsworth and nearby villages with a dozen or more tools at a time, each need-
ing Dick’s attention. Dick sharpened saws and axes, and installed new han-
dles for broken ones. He used some of the broken handles to fashion handles for 
his knives.
I used Dick’s saw filing clamp in 2000 to sharpen his Sandvikens No. 241 
before ripping the half-log fascia to restore the roof of his cabin. The National 
Park Service suggested I use tools already at Twin Lakes where needed to 
supplement those I brought with me. I used Dick’s saw along with a few of 
his other tools, always with reverence. My resharpening the saw a few times 
slightly changed the tooth profile. In hindsight I wish Dick’s saw was now in 
the exact condition he left it. 
In 2000 the amount of restoration needed on Dick’s cabin, cache, wood-
shed and the other three cabins loomed large. The other three cabins needed 
to be restored to some level of comfort for summer staff. Dick’s philosophy of 
getting the job done with the tools you have was always a part of my caring 
for this remote site. When I needed a tool, a piece of gas-can metal, or a specific 
nail, screw or bolt – the only ones available were often from Dick’s supply 
since getting tools and supplies sent in during the summer was nearly impos-
sible. Frequently, I put off doing something so I could bring what was needed 
for a project the following year. Many of my own tools bought to Twin Lakes 
remained throughout the 19 summers of caring for Dick’s cabin to keep from 
repeatedly flying the same tools to the site year after year.
November 25, 1981: 
Trouble in the galley. This morning I noticed that the handle of my 
6-inch cast iron skillet was loose. How in the world could it be loose! 
I had learned it was cracked along one side for a year or two. Close 
examination showed it to be broken down both sides and across a half 
inch above the bottom of the skillet. Broken in such a way that although 
loose it didn’t come detached. A fine kettle of fish – I use it every day 
and have no substitute except maybe an aluminum cover of a camp kit. 
Maybe I could make it solid and durable by bolting a strip of metal on 
the outside. I soon ruled that out as being unsightly and not easy to 
work. How about drilling three holes, one on each side near the top

and one in the center on the bottom. Center the hole on the cracks. Use 
aircraft aluminum rivets with that nice shallow oval head on the inside 
bridging the cracks and peen the outer ends to do the same. I did it and 
it looks professional and is solid. However, I must order myself a new 
6-inch skillet.
January 12, 1983:
This morning my little 6" skillet rebolted – handle came loose again. 
I have been watching for cast iron skillet ads but till now none. Bet if I 
write to L.L. Bean’s customer service they will send me one.
Again I tried aluminum rivets but found them not satisfactory. 
Tightening them pulled the mating edges out of line. So I finally went to 
some very small brass bolts with flat washers. Heads on the inside. Even 
used some epoxy in the seam and on the outside. A real neat and strong 
repair, but it took awhile before I got lined out on the best method.
November 25, 1991:
A package from Raymond, Helen (my sis) and Esther Caporelli. 
Now I have a new 61/2" iron skillet to replace my cracked one. Had to 
do some thing to make it pay today. I took my sled and brought in 2 
more loads of wood from across the lake. That’s about 3 miles worth of 
trudging and then 2 more for my exercise walk.
The new skillet arrived 10 years to the day from when Dick first repaired 
his broken skillet. I’ve always been impressed that someone would even think 
to try to repair a broken cast iron skillet. Before reading Dick’s journals I 
thought Dick didn’t use this little skillet much after it broke. Wrong! Dick used 
his repaired skillet more than any other and for years. 
December 17, 1984:
Another project and that was to rebuild my cheese slicer. A plastic 
handle and it broke. I had a piece of aluminum tubing, which was part 
of one handle of a styrofoam cooler chest, in the woodshed. Epoxy and

September 30, 1977
As I paddled down the sky was clearing fast. A few snow scene 
shots that I wanted from Carrithers point so I beached there. Then as 
the sun came around to noon there were a couple shots from back up at 
the base of Crag mountain, around the bend of the beach and up the 
slope in the scattered spruce. That shot is sure to be a winner – looking 
down the shoreline of Carrithers point with Falls mountain in the back 
ground. The green spruce, the fall colors, the snow, the green lake, the 
mountain, blue sky and a trace of a fog streak. It would be worth all the 
trouble just to look at it through the viewfinder if there was no film in 
the camera.
I would check the Vanderpool cabin. I know that hunters had used 
it this season … From across the lake I had seen what appeared to be 
a framework of the A frame type covered with clear plastic. Below the 
connecting stream and back in the shelter of the spruce. The German 
hunters had camped there… I hiked down to check it out. It was 
intended for a camp. About seven feet up two poles nailed one on each 
side of two trees about ten feet apart. More poles on each side from 
the ground up to the ridge poles and set at an angle making it about 
eight feet wide at ground level. Covered with heavy clear plastic and 
more small poles for bottoms to keep the wind from pulling the plastic 
free. A spruce bough bed along one side. I can see where it would be a 
simple and satisfactory camp. There on the ground a little G.I. trench-
ing shovel (combination hoe and shovel). Just what I always wanted and 
I wondered why they left it. The locking device that makes it a hoe or 
shovel was badly bent and so it was neither and no good. I could fix it 
or fix it so it couldn’t be fixed so I brought it back with me.
October 2, 1977: 
Next, my G.I. shovel. I knocked the pin out that removes the blade. 
Hammered the bent up washer, that holds the blade in position, on 
a flat piece of iron and put it back together. Good as new and in ten 
minutes time.
June 3, 1981: 
No more waiting and wondering about the bear den. Today I would 
climb and from the Emerson Creek side. High and rough with lots of 
loose stuff but I would give her a bloody good try and make it or bust 
the crystal out of my watch trying. Take the crampons for the steep 
loose going. Take the little G.I. folding shovel to uncover the bear den.

Chapter 9
July 1, 1981:  
A beautiful evening with the mountain slopes green and the peaks 
white. Going fishing and just me on the lake. I thought of the Texas 
boys report of the Kenai and the Russian River there. Fisherman stand-
ing side by side. All their fancy and favorite gear beside them. Lines 
getting tangled with those next door. “No way lord, that’s not for me”. 
A couple years ago when I acquired my little G.I. shovel I wondered 
how those German boys could abuse it enough in one hunting trip to 
make it a total loss. In getting the sack of snow I found out. I had cut a 
chunk loose on three sides and then dug down on the fourth side so I 
could sock the shovel under the block and lift, breaking it free. I lifted 
but the blade stayed stationary. The shovel was ka-put just like it was for 
the krauts. A large hand turned nut forces a thin washer against a square 
shoulder on the blade. To lift on the handle with the blade loaded too 
heavy deforms the thin washer and forever after the blade is sloppy 
loose. I managed to get the snow and on the way down I figured out an 
improvement for the Army to think about. I would make a washer out of 
1/8-inch plate. The original was a weak 1/16-inch. The snow in the box, 
I opened the machine shop and soon had tools scattered from the cabin 
to the woodshed. It took a lot of drilling, sawing and filing to make the 
washer. The original I beat back flat that was its original shape. I found 
that I could use both washers and make her “hell for strong”. 11:30 when 
I put the hinge rivet in peened it for staying.
Two years before Dick found this G.I. shovel, he wrote in his journal of 
carrying “my G.I. Shovel” with him. This is an interesting thing to speculate 
about. This type of little folding shovel was a common emergency tool to have 
around. Understanding how well-equipped Spike Carrithers was, it would 
surprise me if Spike did not have a G.I. shovel at Twin Lakes. Dick some-
times carried this little lightweight shovel when hiking.
My best guess is that Dick’s early entry about a G.I. shovel was referring 
to one he acquired from Spike. When he found a dysfunctional shovel, this 
new one became the more interesting of the two. Likely the early G.I. folding 
shovel is the one I found at the ranger cabin on Lower Twin Lakes.

June 13, 1972:
At the mouth of Beech creek the tracks of a sow & cub. A bit far-
ther and I saw a good looking caribou rack on the beach. The remains 
of a siwash camp in the brush and as usual a lot of garbage. A real find. 
Three one-pound cans of sliced bacon. The bears and a wolf had been 
there. I’m surprised the bears hadn’t bit into the bacon cans. More than 
a dozen wiping clothes still in the plastic bag. A good plastic salt or 
pepper shaker with a hinged cap. A pair of worn out hip boots with the 
light nylon tops. A big sheet of clear plastic & a Japanese pack frame. A 
real light weight job and requires only a bit of mending. When the lakes 
are open I will take the canoe and the shovel, bury the trash and haul 
the caribou rack home.
Once Dick found this frame it became the pack he used most often. He made 
several repairs and modifications to the frame including fastening a short section of 
tin can. In this open-ended can he could more securely carry his long telephoto lens.
When one reads “siwash camp,” you may wonder if Dick’s description 
was purposefully derogatory. He sometimes wrote words or phrases that today 
are considered racist or sexist. While reading Dick’s journals there are words 
that trigger memories of my childhood when I, too, heard and used some of the 
words Dick used to describe people. And each time I read on and it becomes 
clear in Dick’s writings that his feelings and relationship with each of those 
people are not reflected in the few words or descriptions he used that are con-
sidered derogatory today. Dick’s journal reveal friends sometimes giving 
back to him with similar language with no bruised feelings.
June 14, 1972: 
This morning, first thing, I would repair that light Japanese pack 
frame. It will be good to use on a trip to the low country. A bit of 
stitching on one five inch back protecting bands and then plenty of 
good “E”poxy glue. Better than new, I figure.
September 16, 1972:
The lake rough but I wanted to get the stuff that Jerg left. I could 
take the pack board and be back by six. A pretty good hike. I had 
told Jerg I could go to the lower end of the lake in a hour and fifteen 
minutes. He allowed I would have to travel some to do it. A square of 
chocolate for the return trip. A sourdough sandwich before I started 
and I was crossing Hope Creek at 2 o’clock. I cut across the mouth of 
Low Pass Creek and traveled blueberry hill to the gravel bank and was 
there in one hr. An hr. ten at the bend of the beach and I went straight 
to Beech Creek and down the beach a few hundred yds. to Jerg’s camp-
site. All the stuff under a small spruce where he said it would be. I left 
his cooking gear, empty cans, a little vinegar and his worn out rubber 
boots. I would pick that garbage up with the canoe. The tent and his left 
over food plus his plastic tarp I lashed on the Japanese pack frame.

September 17, 1974: 
Jerg’s outfit – a few little repair jobs to bring it up to pretty good 
shape. Another job I have been wanting to do was cut the top off of the 
Japanese pack frame. A good rig but miserable in the brush. Those high 
side rails all the time getting hung up. I removed the rubber caps on top. 
Sawed six inches off and put them back – drilled new holes for the pins 
that were at the top and it is ready for a trial run. Low enough now that 
I can see it and still carry my camera (on the tripod) over my shoulder 
that was impossible before.
March 11, 1975: 
At the start of the 200 ft. climb up the gravel bank on the caribou 
trail I dumped my pack to lash the snowshoes on. I was surprised to 
have one of the pack straps to fall completely off top and bottom. Smart 
people those Japanese but they made this set up too cheap. The alumi-
num pin at the top had worn through at the hole that takes a lock ring. 
The ring gone and no telling how far back. At the lower end the web 
strap had worn and torn out on one side. Six miles from home and broke 
down. I robbed a pin from the side rail at the top where it wasn’t so crit-
ical and replaced it with the worn pin. At the bottom I made a new slot 
in the web strap and shoe buttoned it over the pin and washer.

August 29, 1977: 
A few small chores and I was unemployed. I had to stay close in case 
the plane came. I still had the bucked lengths of a good dead tree cut 
in 1975 to pack in. Another fifteen minutes per round trip deal and it 
was heavy stuff. I took my pack board and headed back. There would be 
six loads and three of them go as hundred lbs. That would test my new 
improved tump line set up and me too. Worked good and I wouldn’t 
trade a good old Army molded plywood pack board for two of the fancy 
ones. Second trip and I met Mrs. Hooper on the trail. She was out 
walking trails and studying bird life. I mentioned quite a few cranber-
ries. She didn’t recognize them and hesitated to pick any. Next trip I 
came onto a cup of cranberries along the trail. She had gone on to pick 
blueberries. Six loads it was. A lot of good wood near the woodshed for 
some one to burn if they found me gone come winter.
There were two G.I. pack frames left at Twin Lakes in 2000. One Dick 
used to pack the three loads of gear from Lower Twin Lakes to his building 
site in 1968 and again later that year to pack out the Dall sheep he shot for

meat. The one he most used in 1968 is likely the one that still hangs on the wall 
alongside Dick’s bunk bed where he left it.
When one looks at photographs or film of Dick’s life at Twin Lakes, he 
uses a molded plywood U.S. Army, G.I. pack frame only until he found the 
aluminum Japanese frame. From that time on, he used the lighter-weight 
Japanese frame except to pack firewood and other heavy loads.
I have seen one photo of Dick wearing a red nylon pack with a skimpy 
built-in frame. Dick left it hanging in Weisser’s cabin. It was his least-used 
frame.
February 13, 1986: 
Today I needed to overhaul my Japanese pack frame. Just made it 
home yesterday with out a complete failure. The top cross bar that the 
shoulder straps anchor to broke in the middle from metal fatigue.
I had some aluminum tent poles from a tent wrecked by the wind 
on the lower lake. Two sizes and I would use the large size. In cutting 
and drilling I was surprised how soft it was. The smaller was stron-
ger. The large one would sleeve over the small one perfectly. So I went 
that route. There were long screws through the side rails and threaded 
into nylon inserts in the cross bar. There I was stuck but not for long. I 
drilled the holes in the side rails over size to take 20-penny nails. Cut 
two to 31/2". Worked down a small spruce pole to a tight fit in the cross 
bar. Hammered it through full length. Drilled under size holes to take 
the 20-penny pegs. Epoxy for the holes and saw dust mixed with epoxy 
to bed the ends for a perfect fit. Hammered those pins in, and they were 
very tight. I guaranteed it to last the duration.
The sun was getting low. I lashed on my new crampons and went a 
mile down.
 July 21, 1987: 
I put a new shoulder strap on my Japanese pack frame.
October 17, 1987: 
Hotcakes and chores, laundry and then I worked at repairing my 
light Japanese pack frame. One of the shoulder straps needed a new end 
where it anchors to the frame.
September 9, 1980: 
Coming back I used my “Old Timer” to cut a dwarf birch and was 
a little surprised when the blade came free and fell to the ground. Now 
I could see what was causing the trouble. The pin through the blade was 
badly worn and had broken in the center. A second blade on the same 
pin so I took it out and wrapped them in my bandana for safe delivery to 
the knife repair shop.

the broken pin out. I couldn’t make another such as the original for it 
had a head on each end and the bolster covered the heads. I would drill 
through the bolsters and chamfer the holes on the outside so I could 
peen the ends of a full-length pin. For a pin I would use the shank of a 
broken drill and I would guarantee it to last a lifetime.
Misting showers covered the lake and up country appeared to be 
getting wet. The knife ready for full duty I looked at my bear damaged 
big window.
Prior to the blade falling out of his knife, Dick complained of the blade 
getting loose several times.
April 5, 1981:
Last mail a letter came from Schrade Walden builder of the “Old 
Timer”. They wrote, mail it to them insured and if they find that it was 
defective they would send me a new one. I think it a stronger knife, 
since I put the drill shank pin in it, than their new one, but I may do it.
April 6, 1981:
Cleaned and polished my “Old Timer” pocketknife before sending it 
back to Schrade Cutlery Corp.
May 23, 1981:
I studied some of my mail again and admired my brand new “Old 
Timer” from “Schrade Walden”. A card came with it and reads. “Please 
accept this knife with our compliments. We take as much pride in our 
craft, as we do in your continued friendship.” This one a better knife 
than the other when new.
A few years ago a visitor to Dick’s cabin, Jeff Myers, brought with him 
a varnished walking staff that Dick had given him in 1997. Examining the 
walking staff I asked Jeff if it was he or Dick who had broken and repaired 
the staff. I knew Dick had repaired it because the little excess glue had not 
been wiped off the repair. Jeff was discouraged to think that Dick had given 
him a broken walking stick. “I didn’t know the staff had been broken,” Jeff 
said. I told him there was not a single item in Dick’s cabin with Dick’s ini-
tials (RLP) but there were items throughout Dick’s possessions with repairs 
and several with repairs of repairs. I showed him Dick’s broken and repaired 
walking/measuring stick next to where we were standing and said that the 
closest thing to Dick signing a handcrafted item was his repair. Jeff departed 
treasuring his gift from Dick. 
Jeff told me Dick had many nice walking sticks and had offered each per-
son in his party the gift of one. Jeff was the only person who accepted Dick’s 
offer. He said he chose the stick he thought Dick would be least likely to use. I 
imagine Dick gave many beautiful staffs as gifts.
Walking Sticks
388 
	
Chapter 9
Dick had many walking sticks. Pictures show Dick using a variety of long 
walking sticks. He also used shorter graduated sticks for measuring ice and 
snow depths. Dick left more than a half-dozen graduated sticks in his wood-
shed, several with a nail fashioned to delineate “zero.” Dick left a three-foot 
graduated walking stick with a cut-off nail marking “zero” in his outhouse. It 
had broken and Dick had repaired it. 
The hooked nail at the end of Dick’s slender nine-foot pole would be per-
fect for retrieving a lost fishing lure from the dryness of his canoe. But why did 
Dick also make it a measuring stick by cutting “Vs” at 6" intervals? Whatever 
Dick was measuring, he wanted exact numbers he could remember when 
journaling whatever observations he made.

Dick made careful observations before journaling ice, snow and weather 
conditions throughout the day along with his morning weather observations 
– what a valuable resource, a treasure, Dick left.
July 22, 1969:
For this afternoon I had a project in mind. Show my flatlander 
guest how the wood gets to the wood box. We hunted up a good tree 
– cut it and packed it in. I had him bucking it up while I dropped 
another (all but dead) and obstructing my view of Bell’s mountain. He 
remarked that he would be hungry after cutting all that wood so I fixed 
plenty and I do believe he ate as much as I. Getting to the point where 
I must get my half of that third biscuit or I end up with one third of the 
pan of three.
June 6, 1972:
I need a new wood box. It’s hard to imagine a sturdy corrugated box 
handling all the wood burned since August in 1968 but it did. Beefed up 
some but never failed. In the woodshed last winter a squirrel or por-
cupine ate a big hole in the bottom. I had another good sturdy box but 
too long. I cut it in two and lapped the halves 31⁄ 2 inches and glued it 
together. Built a rack of small poles to cradle it in. Tomorrow I will give 
it the severe test.
June 10, 1972:
A few odd jobs while they bubbled. Get more driftwood, complete 
my wood box (pretty fancy).
June 10, 1976:
This would be clean up day about my diggins. Too much of saving 
scraps and not enough of burning. I got reckless and made a clean tour. 
My old faithful wood box that went into service in 68 had to go. A 
new one had been standing by for a few years now. Many wood scraps, 
cans & bottles got the axe. Clean it up for visitors who are sure to 
come. Three trips to Hope’s Cabin to dig out my antler and ram horn 
relics. Bring down my heavy rustic chair to park under the spruce near 
the beach.
Dick’s heavy rustic chair from Hope’s cabin is the chair he made in 1967,

Two rolls of 35 mm to go so got it packed. A few more small chores and

tables looking weathered so I sanded one and gave it a coat of varnish.

March 1, 1986:
Is the cold spell running out of steam? Only -38° instead of the 
increasing cold and two -40’s. I burned more wood for I had the fire to 
the front and just a trifle more draft. My wood box holds two cubic feet 
of wood but of course not a true amount due to wood not laying close. 
In this kind of weather I burn about one and one half boxes per 24 hrs. 
Could burn two boxes full if I got reckless.
December 16, 1987:
After breakfast and doing my carpet. I had emptied the sweeper 
in the dustpan that was in the wood box when the brush fell out of the 
sweeper. Never had that happened before, in fact, it doesn’t come out 
easy when I take it out to comb it clean. I found the peg that carries one 
end of the brush had come out of the sweeper housing. Just the end of 
the peg through a hole and mushroomed a bit and evidently not enough. 
Boy! I had better find that little monster or I would have to make one. 
So, I lit the Coleman for good light and promptly found it in the wood 
box. Part of the peg assembly is a dish shaped washer that rests against 
the sweeps housing. Fixing it was a job made to order for “epoxy” the 
substance that holds Twin Lakes together. I wasn’t long fixing it and did 
the other side as well.
I don’t know what Dick’s sweeper was. Dick installed indoor/outdoor 
carpet over the gravel floor in 1979. It remained until Dick left. Dick wanted 
it removed when he didn’t return in 2000 so the National Park Service took 
it out at that time.
June 2, 1988:
This morning I would overhaul my wood box. It is about 20 yrs. old 
and was made from a heavy cardboard egg case and a few sticks. Cords 
and cords of wood have been packed from the wood shed in it. Good for 
another ten, fifteen years now that it has been beefed up and given a coat 
of green paint. My woodpile built up it was nearly time for lunch.
November 10, 1989: 
Clear, calm and -20° 
After lunch the weather closed in from the northeast. It was nearly 
solid overcast. I wrote a letter and worked on my snowshoes and wood 
box. I often think of Hollis when my wood box comes front and center. 
At my invitation, years ago, he and a fish and game employee stayed 
in my cabin one cold night while I was gone. Later I asked him how it 
was and what changes he would make. “The cabin was fine” he said, but 
he thought I should have a larger wood bin or wood box. “I filled that 
sucker three times during the night” he said. I couldn’t understand for 
a heaping box of wood will run me until about noon next day in cold 
weather. They must have left the draft open the whole night.

February 2, 1991: 
Partly cloudy, Calm and -30° 
The night’s comfort is determined by the weight of the wood 
packed. My wood box has a handle on both ends. I fill it in the wood-
shed and pack the nights supply in one trip. Last evening it was espe-
cially heavy and I had an easy night. My fire check times were 12:15, 
03:00, 06:00. Nearly slept my fire out one time. -30° is noticeably 
warmer than -39°.
February 7, 1991: 
Clear, Calm and -50°
I read some of the newspapers that came with Leon and Andy and 
later went to Hope’s cabin for a gallon of oats before sawing and splitting 
a few to make the pile look good after me lugging in a heavy wood box 
full. To end the day I started across but came back for my neck gaiter.
December 21, 1991: 
Nearly clear, calm and -43° 
An ambitious fire – I was up and down a lot. Can’t just let it burn 
or the wood box would run dry and the cabin too warm. Ashes would 
slow it down but when I was well snuggled in I would hear it coming to 
life. That full moon was as white as the snow and I figured maybe -35° 
come morning. In the cabin I saw no indication that it was a -43° when I 
rolled out. My homemade thermopanes had a line of ice along the lower 
edge and the custom made true thermopane was about one third covered 
with ice.
Dick told many people his homemade thermopanes worked more effec-
tively than the commercial-glass variety at minimizing the build-up of ice.
August 20, 1992:
My wood box, the only wood box I have ever had and now more 
than 24 yrs. old was made from a 30 dozen egg case of hard pressed 
paper fitted into a wood carrying frame. I would like to see the pile of 
wood that has been in and out of that wood box. Now the corners were 
suffering from abuse while filling it at the woodshed. I split a one gallon 
fuel can into 4 equal parts and used the corners to armor plate the cor-
ners of the wood box. Used wire fasteners to hold them in place. Some 
green paint to paint them to match the box. An improvement. 
Dick seems to have forgotten he made this wood box in 1972 and put 
it into service in 1976. The box I found in his cabin in 2000 matched the 
description of the one he fabricated in 1972 with the armor plated corners he 
added in 1992.

quiet night and kept my hot hired girls busy. Had one stick of wood in 
the wood box come reveille time at 07:00.
Ho Boy! There she was, a lake full of ice and mostly white with 
frost. I went down with my walking stick and by stomping hard I could 
poke a hole through. About one half inch of ice I figured.
During Dick’s visit to his cabin in 2000, K. asked him the use of the two 
smooth-rounded rocks that were sitting on the top of his wood stove. They 
were a little larger than oranges but somewhat flattened. Dick picked one up 
and said, “I call these my girls. I warm them up and take them to bed with me 
at night.” He chuckled as he sat the rock back on his wood stove, turned from 
K. and walked through his Dutch door. When visitors ask about the stones, 
their laughter always follows our story. 
These are the hot rocks Dick placed on his desk next to his writing hand 
(Chapter 2, Page 150) when the temperature reached -78°.
It was Raymond Proenneke who suggested Dick film his cabin building. 
Raymond purchased and sent the 8mm Bolex movie camera Dick used to 
film the building of his cabin and cache. Raymond told me he later purchased 
and sent Dick the 16mm Bolex movie camera, the one Dick used to film 
wildlife for the National Park Service. Dick had several telephoto lenses. 
With adapters they could be used on either the Bolex movie camera or on his 
Exakta SLR. Remember that Dick’s time at Twin Lakes was before digital 
cameras. He was shooting movie film with a wind-up camera and slides 
with film. He sent the shot film out for developing and once developed, some 
of it was sent to his brother Raymond in California and some was sent to 
the National Park Service in Harpers Ferry, Virginia. He was not able to 
view his movie film for months or years after it was taken.
Dick secured his handcrafted telephoto lens case made from a 4" section of 
chimney pipe to his Japanese pack frame by resting it in the open-ended tin 
can fastened to the pack frame as pictured earlier in this chapter.
February 7, 1969: 
Partial high overcast, calm and a -26°. Ideal weather. Cold enough 
to be calm and a good chance of sunshine.
Today would be the day to go up country and I was anxious to be on 
my way. … I left the lake at the upper end. 
Quite a few ptarmigan tracks but few moose tracks on the flats. I 
could see trails on the lower slope of the mt. on the left and soon spotted 
two big moose. One black and the other brown. I got the camera set up 
and worked their way. Close enough and they seemed not afraid. The 
tripod handle in the way so I would rotate the camera a bit. Then it hap-
pened. The camera fell off the tripod and onto a snowshoe breaking the

tiny thread on the auto timer. The thread on the adapter in the base of 
the camera had broken off letting the camera fall. I was wearing heavy 
mittens too which didn’t help in the least. Camera full of snow and the 
moose moved to the open. I shook the snow off and shot a few frames 
as the camera was so cold it would only run about half speed. Better I 
should have left it in camp and taken the spotting scope. The big black 
moose was a bull I am quite sure – if so he has lost his antlers. 
February 8, 1969:
A day to open up the machine shop and repair yesterdays damage. 
By making some alterations and doing some improvising and using a 
little epoxy glue I feel that I am more in business than before. 
A sourdough sandwich. A plan of attack figured to fix my camera 
gear, my chores done. A beautiful sunset – just enough clouds to make it 
nice. I watched the peaks lose their pink at 5 o’clock. Now we are mak-
ing progress in lengthening the day light hrs. 
March 22, 1969:
I was not completely satisfied with the threaded plate (for my 400 
lens) made of gas can tin and epoxy and wondered if I could do better. 
I had everything to make it with except a 1/4" nc thread tap. The 1/4 
in. cap screws holding the bottom on my stove are better material than 
mild steel. I would try to make a tap. File six cutting edges across the 
threads equally spaced and taper it a bit on the end to get it started. Use 
a drill that would slip through a quarter in. nut. Doubtful if I could get it 
started in such a small hole. Bacon grease for cutting oil. Use lots of down 
pressure and hope it starts. It did and didn’t hesitate about going through. 
It raised the metal around the hole on both sides of my 1/8" thick plate

but I could file that smooth. A good looking thread – how lucky can you 
get. Clean one side and score it good to make a good bond. Peel the tin 
plate from the scope and give it the same treatment. A coat of five minute 
epoxy – put them together with several rubber bands for pressure – the 
job was done. And still it snowed and I studied my books. 
May 14, 1976:
Now, the search for the adaptor. I had leveled the floor this morning 
and that would have buried it for sure. I crawled about from end to end 
looking and scratching. Little hope of finding it and all the time figur-
ing how I could improve and use the timer without it. Extend the length 
of the plunger. Drill a small hole in the end of a finish nail and then 
file it down to the proper size. Epoxy the short length on the end of the 
plunger. The hole drilled 1/8" deep to slip over the plunger and I was 
ready to dress it down. Making good progress putting things together 
and then the cable release came apart. This just wasn’t my day. I had to 
shorten the cable housing to make the thing work. More epoxy to put 
it together. It was getting late for supper. Snow had stopped with about 
two and one half inches on the ground. I went out with my cardboard 
scraper and brushed the load from the cub. There, I noticed for the first 
time that some varmint has been eating the G.I. duffle bag holding the 
big rocks for the wing tie down. From the great amount already missing 
it could only be a porcupine.
May 15, 1976:
I had checked out my modification on the automatic timer but one 
final minor adjustment had it working perfect. A full 15 second delay 
and a run that would exceed the capacity of the camera spring if need 
be. I was happy with the rig and shot eighty feet of film before I called it 
good and headed home.
May 25, 1976:
This morning until the weather improved I would engineer a 
fastening device to mount my automatic timer on the camera. I have 
been using heavy rubber bands but they are a nuisance and fail to hold 
it in place when I pack the tripod and camera over my shoulder. I 
could use the existing hooks on the cover. Not using the side-mounted 
viewfinder. It has no useful function. I would attempt to build an over 
center latch such as is used on luggage. What to build it from. I wanted 
aluminum but all I had was tubing. With my little hacksaw I split 
a length and opened it up – flattened it on my strap iron anvil. That 
would be satisfactory so I cut, split and flattened enough to make the 
five pieces required.

good use of the automatic timer. I got set up and was ready. Pushed the 
button on the timer and got to my stand. I had listened for the camera 
to stop but didn’t. I found that it hadn’t run. The timer failed to push the 
button. Some testing showed that it wasn’t working properly. Running 
about six seconds of the 15 sec. delay and then stopping. It wouldn’t do 
better no matter what I tried and I decided to come back. I could have 
climbed for footage of the bears but being dead calm and the sun bright. 
The flow of air would be up the mountain. Along might come a down 
lake breeze and I would be found out. Better I should come back across 
while the crossing was good. That warm sun would soon soften last nights 
freezing. I packed up and headed back. By doing a lot of detouring and 
much holding of breath I got out to better going. No load and it would 
have been nothing but packing a load of gear and go through – it would 
be quite a struggle to say the least. Back on my own side and glad that I 
hadn’t hiked the seven miles to find out that the timer was haywire.
I would take the silly thing apart and see what the trouble was. I 
moved my wash table out in the sun and covered it with my canvas bed 
spread. The cover off and I found many little gears, springs, etc. These 
I picked out one at a time and finally came to the end. Everything 
appeared to be in good order but a close look with a magnifying glass 
showed the last big gear in the box had three teeth plugged with 
something that looked like aluminum solder. That was the reason for 
the short run and stop. The plugged teeth coming in contact with the 
driving gear next in line. With a pin I cleaned the teeth and rinsed the

works in Jet fuel B. Ready to go back in the reverse order of disassembly. 
I got all the parts in and the cover on after giving it a blast of WD40. It 
worked perfectly and I was pretty proud of my watch repair job.
June 3, 1976:
This would be a day to do odd jobs around camp. Work some of the 
bugs out of my automatic timer was first on the list. Twice yesterday it 
didn’t shut off and ran a full winding of the camera spring motor. That 
will never do. The cable release had too much spring tension, so much 
that the timer had all it could do to trip the shutter mechanism. The 
failure to stop was easy enough to remedy. Wind it up and then set the 
timer pointer back a quarter turn, which leaves a quarter turn of spring 
tension instead of practically none. The cable release was something else. 
In its full length an outer cloth cover then a coil of flat spring steel, then 
a full-length spring and then the plunger cable. All four of them have to 
be about right for length or it just doesn’t work. Good thing that it was 
plenty long for I was shortening by various amounts, each in turn to get 
the desired action on the plunger. By eleven o’clock I was giving it a test 
run on the camera and decided it was working just about right.
I’ve included only a small portion of Dick’s entries about working on his 
photography equipment. He had to repair his own equipment if he was going 
to film and photograph in the remoteness of Twin Lakes. Dick could not send 
his equipment to be repaired elsewhere in a timely fashion. 
Dick left many used photography accessories in his cache, and most had 
been modified. Many visitors asked about his cameras and we had to tell them 
all of Dick’s photographic equipment was moved from his cabin to the archives 
in 2000.
When Bill and Connie Markis visited Dick’s cabin in 2015 they spoke of 
raising their two boys watching the videos of Dick Proenneke’s life at Twin 
Lakes. Bill worked many years at Dave’s Camera Shop in Anchorage. When I 
realized his great interest in seeing Dick’s optical equipment, I offered to visit 
the archives with him.
At the end of the season, I joined Bill on one of the two days he spent 
going through Dick’s optical equipment. Katie Myers, the museum’s curator, 
documented Bill’s expertise with photographs and descriptions, and of Bill’s 
removal of many corroding batteries. This effort reflects the community of 
friends of Dick keeping his spirit alive. Using Bill’s documentation will make 
purchasing identical stand-ins to have at Dick’s cabin much easier. Having a 
complement of Dick’s optical equipment would enable future visitors to more 
closely envision this part of Dick’s life.
July 4, 1981:
I read my mail and lashed old glory to a spruce pole and mounted 
it at the corner of the cabin. I had laid it out last evening so I wouldn’t 
forget. Bob Acheson would be proud of me as it was he and Betty who

insisted that I have a flag and gave me one. They fly the flag on a tall flag 
pole everyday. 
July 6, 1981:
Flag day every day since July 3rd. Old Glory looks good at the cor-
ner of the cabin. Red, white, and blue goes well with the green moss on 
the roof and the pink wild roses in the front yard. I’ll call this the “Twin 
Lakes Ranger Station”. Bob and Betty Acheson would approve. 
July 16, 1981:
I wanted to get a first class pole for my flag. A good tall, straight 
slender one. The pole patch below Jerre’s would be the place to find one. 
Put a little romance in the trip and use the good old L.L. Bean paddle 
instead of the wig wagging aluminum and plastic water dripper inner. 
I found a good pole and took it along – parked the canoe on the first 
good beach this side of Emerson’s point and took to the wet brush. This 
would be the test for my new “Orvis” nylon chaps, a Christmas present 
from sister Florence. 
The lake still mirror smooth but a light breeze would over take me 
as I paddled to the Hope Creek campground with the pole. I would peel 
it there and add the bark to the existing pile of tepee pole bark. 
I found one chap at the lower twin ranger cabin in 2003 and the other at 
Dick’s cabin.	
July 17, 1981:
My draw knife made short work of the flag pole bark over at the 
campground. Then into the lake to wash the sap off. Back over to my 
woodshed to trim the ends and knots real neat before a wash down with 
diesel fuel to prevent mildew. A nice straight slender one and a foot and 
a half longer than the tepee pole I was using. 
The flag pole was ready for the finishing touch. Add a couple quarter 
inch pegs at a 50° angle to form a cleat to secure halyard to. I made the 
switch and old glory looks good up there. Flying the flag should be a 
must when living in the Ntl. Park. 
July 19, 1981:
Today and after some sox laundry I would build an ornamental cap 
for the new flag pole. I had debated whether to make it a ball, pyramid 
or cone. A pyramid would be nice but a cone nicer I figured and a bit 
more work. I had a good chunk of clear spruce seasoned since cabin 
building days. It was 23⁄4" thick so I would make the diameter that size. 
The height 31⁄4". I made the socket first so I could stick it on a stick of 
kindling wood to hold it while I used the block plane to round the cor-
ners. Cupped the bottom with the gouge chisel to make it more artistic. 
It shaped up fast and by eleven I had it varathaned, dry and on the pole.

Chapter 9
Looks real good. A slip fit so I can remove it to stow the pole under the 
eave of the cabin. 
That flag pole looked real good from the lake. 
Visitors asked many times about a little conical piece of wood on the shelf 
above Dick’s Dutch door. I had no idea what it was. It is so perfectly shaped 
that I told people I thought it had been turned on a lathe and did not think 
Dick made it.
When I arrived at Twin Lakes in 2000, the tip of Dick’s old flag pole had 
broken off so I examined photos of the flag flying, trying unsuccessfully to find 
an image of Dick’s pulley system. I replicated Dick’s flag pole in 2000, and 
shortly thereafter a black bear climbed on the roof, stood up and pulled the flag 
with its teeth until the pole broke.  
In reading Dick’s journals, I identified the little conical piece of wood as 
Dick’s flag pole finial. I also found the finial in photographs taken after 1981. 
Dick raised his American flag every day and the National Park Service has 
flown it since Dick departed. I was never able to replicate a finial but having 
one on Dick’s flag pole would add authenticity to his historic cabin.
August 8, 1981:
I checked my trot line to make sure I didn’t have another fish on 
before taking down the flag and securing for the night. 
November 6, 1981:
To end the day I scraped my pathways smooth with the king size 
snow shovel. Cleared the snow from and around the canoe on the beach. 
Lowered Old Glory and wrapped it for storage up under the eave.
December 20, 1981:
Hotcakes and fair considering no real live eggs in the cabin. 
Morning chores and I found my flag frozen. Taking it down I just 
revolve the pole and wrap the flag close before tucking it up under the 
eave. Melt water had gotten to it and frozen. I should have used some 
warm water to free it completely before trying to unwrap it. Tore it along 
the trailing end and three short tears in board. I was surprised how very 
weak the fabric was and allowed that if at the present date “Uncle Sam” 
is as weak as my flag we are in deep danger. I hung it over the stove 
and then got Betsy Ross to stitch up the damage. The cloth so weak 
that I doubted very much if the stitches would stay so I looked for some 
thing to strengthen it a bit. I could rub in some Elmer’s wood glue as 
I did stitching on my wool shirt. But I had something else that is clear 
and water proof. “New Skin” the liquid dressing that comes in a bottle. 
Disinfects as well as protects. A very sanitary repair job.

took until lunch time. I hoisted old glory but the wind was so strong I 
took it down thinking it might come apart. I’ll have to approach Paul 
Haertel (Park Superintendent) about furnishing a flag if I will display it 
every flyable day. 
January 28, 1982:
She had asked me if there was a post office here because of the flag. 
That would be nice – mail day three times per week in summer and 
twice weekly in winter. 
June 5, 1982:
I had hoisted Old Glory this morning … This afternoon I noticed 
a big tear in it near the lower edge. I took it down and hung it over the 
stove to dry. The material of very poor quality and almost impossible 
to sew with a needle. The blue badly bleached and next time the Park 
Service comes I will ask them if they will furnish a flag if I fly it every 
reasonable day. If they refuse I will display my “Reagan Country” sign 
and recommend that Park Service jobs be put up for bid. Man offering 
top dollar gets to do what they are doing. 
Near evening I sawed and split a few to keep in practice. Had an 
early supper and then took a look at Old Glory. To sew it would be like 
sewing cheese cloth so I looked to my Silicone seal supply. Coat a quar-
ter inch strip along each edge and make a lap joint. Sew it after it cured 
if I think it needs it for durability. 
July 20, 1982:
The door opened and out climbed Paul Haertel of the Park Service 
and Superintendent of Lake Clark Ntl. Park. A big smile on his face as 
he always has when it is good news or bad. Out climbed a big man and 
he greeted me by using my first name. He was a politician for sure and 
he had been briefed. “Did you order this beautiful morning,” he asked. 
Three more climbed out but none as important as he by appearance or 
action. He said “I’ll bet you get tired of people coming here.” “This is 
certainly a beautiful spot.” They stood on the beach and talked a few 
minutes and then up the path to the cabin. He had a lot of questions. 
Was the roof satisfactory? How cold in winter and did I get out much 
at 50 below? He had to inspect the wooden hinges and work the night 
latch. He commented on my flying the flag and that he did at his home 
every day also. I said that I needed a new one he said “we can arrange 
that. I’ll send you one that has flown over the White House.” 
August 13, 1982:
On my clothesline hung my new improved flag. It was getting badly 
tattered so I cut off four inches and cemented and sewed a new hem 
yesterday afternoon. The blue had faded badly but at least the flag looks 
proud.

They flew away and I came back to give my mail a quick once over. 
A box from the Dept. of Interior and I knew that my flag had arrived. 
I opened the box to find it was a 5 x 8 foot flag. Some flag for a 12 x 16 
cabin. A certificate came with it stating that it had been flown over the 
white house for Dick Proenneke on July 29th 1982 at the request of the 
honorable Ted Stevens, United States Senator – Beg your pardon – It 
was flown over the United States Capitol. 
September 5, 1982:
A letter from Ray Arnett, Assistant Secretary for Fish & Wildlife 
and Parks. He writes – 
Good Morning Dick: 
	
It was a pleasure to meet you and encouraging to know that 
the wilderness still attracts men like you who truly respect wild 
creatures and their habitat. 
	
Unlike so many people, you have found a way of life that 
is suited to your needs, gratifying and constructive without 
infringing on the rights of others. You have every reason to be 
proud of your accomplishments and I congratulate you for the 
benevolent caretaker role you have assumed over your domain. 
 
I have asked my National Park Service staff to acquire a 
copy of your book and deliver it to you with my request for your 
autograph. Time did not permit me to acquire a copy in Anchorage 
during my last trip, but I did review a copy while visiting Glen 
and Sharon Van Valen on Lake Clark. It is a splendid account of 
your life on Twin Lakes and I will enjoy an autographed copy for 
my library. 
	
Best wishes to you, my friend, for continued happiness and 
excellent health. 
Kindest, personal regards, Sincerely, 
G. Ray Arnett 
and a letter from Ted Stevens, United States Senate. It goes — 
Dear Dick: 
 
Ray Arnett told me how much he enjoyed meeting you and 
what a fabulous job you have done. He mentioned that it looked 
like you needed a new flag, so I am sending along one that has 
been flown over the U.S. Capitol. It sounds like you will put it to 
good use. 
With best wishes, Cordially,

My Old Glory needed mending after yesterdays very strong wind. 
A rip in it more than a foot long which I would give the herring bone 
stitch and a coat of silicone seal to make it durable. From a gas can car-
rying handle I fashioned and installed a hook to the top of the flag pole. 
Fix it so I can remove and fold the flag instead of wrapping it around the 
pole. 
January 21, 1983:
This morning I took a look at my poor old flag. Getting pretty ratty 
looking along the wind whipped edge. I could cut it off another three 
inches and hem it again but the heavy hem causes it to fail next to the 
hem – very weak fabric. This time I wouldn’t hem it. Treat the edge with 
silicone seal to prevent it from fraying and see how it lasts. Saving that 
new larger one for the tourist season.

I wrote until noon and after lunch wanted to get the film out of the 
Exakta so I dug out and unfolded that new 5' x 8' flag. Ran it up for a few 
pictures. Sure is a pretty thing – the colors so bright. 100% cotton and a 
heavy made string by Valley Forge Flag Company, Spring City, Pennsy. 
“Number one in flags throughout the world,” or so it says on the box.

Considerable snow up there and it is just naturally a nice scene. So – 
I run up the new flag and took a picture from in front of the cabin – the 
cabin, flag and snowy mts. 
The day was about gone. I had some drift wood to work up and some 
laundry to bring in. That huge flag to take down. Not as easy to manage 
as the little one that has been shortened three times. I wanted to gather

some fireweed for a first fireweed salad. I would have an early supper and 
enjoy the lively water out front. The ice had been here 188 days. 
Fifteen years ago this day I started to work on my cabin. Babe had 
flown me in and had to land at the upper end of the lower lake as this 
one was still iced over but the ice unsafe to travel. I made two trips 
packing my gear up that day and one the next morning to complete the

Glen stretched the truth a bit when he told him, Dick Proenneke 
lives alone for months without seeing anyone. 10 weeks was the lon-
gest ever and Babe waiting for a full load of mail. Noon time came

flag whipped and snapped in the wind. It is much more noisy than one 
made of cotton.

One of the pegs forming the cleat on my flag pole got broken some 
how. It was 1/4" dia. and of spruce which isn’t much for tough. So I 
made one from axe handle wood and how do you make a round dowel 
quick and easy. Rip out a square stick, knock the corners off with the 
axe and drive it through a steel washer with the required size hole for 
the dowel diameter. It comes out perfect and polished too. Drilled a 
hole, gave it some Elmers glue and drove it in place.

December 22, 1985:
It is the best flag I have ever seen. No sign of weakening after at 
least a couple years of weather but it strikes me as not having the very 
bright colors that it had when new. That may be partially due to smoke 
from the chimney. 
May 15, 1986:
My good bright colored flag is giving me cause for concern. Where 
does a real strong heavy flag fail first? Along the top and bottom hem 
near the end. The fabric breaks length wise next to the hem. I have saved 
it and coated it with liquid rubber and that causes it to break next to the 
coated fabric. So this time I sewed it and then varathaned the area. Still 
pliable and not so heavy. 
June 3, 1986:
I noticed Old Glory failing at the trailing corners again. Too many 
days of strong wind and the flag material heavy with heavier seams. 
The whipping and snapping breaks the material. So, I sewed up a few 
breaks and debated what to use to strengthen the fabric. I had tried liq-
uid rubber and next Varathane. Both make the material heavy and stiff. 
I had a little red oxide paint which matched the red of the flag exactly. 
So I painted both sides and pinned it on the clothesline to dry. To 
finish up the can of paint I painted a few items that had been painted 
red before. 
October 27, 1986:
Old Glory is showing her age. Sun is hard on nylon and the flag 
must be four yrs. old and in the weather nearly every day. It breaks along 
the seams at the corners. So I sewed the rips and coated them with a 
thin film of liquid rubber. 
November 1, 1986:
To finish the day I wrote letters and listened to the soft rustle of 
a real nice all cotton flag sent to me by ex Trooper Carl. He was at a 
garage sale and thought of me and Old glory – bought me a new flag. 
December 15, 1986:
I had breakfast and got the cabin squared away before running up 
old glory. The wind was punishing it badly and so I traded it for the small 
cotton flag sent to me by Carl the ex trooper. Nylon flags are nice when 
new but they are noisy and just don’t perform like a soft cotton flag.

split a few chunks and waited for sun set on the peaks. 
November 25, 1987:
A box from my sister Helen and not heavy at all, what could that 
be. A brand new Iowa flag to keep Old Glory company. An expensive 
$37.00 nylon flag. 
January 14, 1988:
I got busy and it was surprising how much I found to do. To get 
more light and a better looking cabin I took my storm windows off. 
I moved some storage cans outside and swapped my ratty flag for the 
bright cotton one. I tucked things out of sight here and there and stuffed 
some in the cache. When this project is complete I will be weeks finding 
everything. Noon time came and no Jay. One o’clock came and no 
airplane. I had changed to my civilized pants and shirt. If all this effort 
was wasted I wouldn’t be dancing with joy. And then I heard it and it 
was Jays nice looking 180 that flashed by. 
February 28, 1988:
I was going to fly my pretty cotton flag today but noticed one corner 
starting to fray so ran up the ratty nylon rag and spent some time beef-
ing up the corners of the prettiest flag I have. It just looks better when in 
action than a nylon flag. 
June 14, 1988:
Today, according to my calendar, was flag day. Just for that I would 
fly a new old glory and below it the new Iowa flag of the same size. It 
took a little preparation to rig the two of them and they looked nice 
with the fresh breeze to bring them to life. 
July 4, 1988:
Today the 4th I flew my new old glory with the new Iowa flag below 
it. The Iowa flag is of lighter material and more lively than the heavy 
stars & stripes. 
August 11, 1989:
Morning came and I was fifteen minutes early getting down for we 
agreed on six o’clock. A smoke from the chimney and she was putting 
up old glory plus a white one below it. It was the Rhode Island state flag 
and the first of its kind I had ever seen. She said, “well, if those Iowa 
guys can fly the Iowa flag I can mine.”  
Dick frequently had women visitors stay in his cabin and he would stay 
in Spike’s cabin. Sometimes men visitors stayed in Dick’s cabin with him but 
more often they stayed in Spike’s or Hope’s cabin.

I got there about 20 min. before six to find Esther [Caporelli] run-
ning up the two flags. 
August 20, 1989:
A real good night and I was ready to go by 5:30. We had decided 
06:30 to start breakfast due to it being Sunday. I built a fire in Spike’s 
little square stove and heated water for a bath if I needed it or not. 
Esther was running up the flags as I came down the beach.

In the 1990 interview with Theodore Karamanski, Ted asked, “You seem 
to delight in improvising, in making things from something into something 
quite different. Is it out of necessity, is it part of your personality or…” 
Dick responded:  “Well, anybody can buy it in the store, if you got a store… 
I kind of enjoy making things you can use and would prefer to use them over 
what you would buy in the store.”
Ted: “Cause it’s yours.”
Dick: “Yeh. Because you made it and it’s your ingenuity that made it 	
 possible and figured it out and I get a lot of satisfaction out of, well, making 
something with nothing, you know. But I don’t know if that’s the proper way 
to look at it.”
Ted: “Have you done that your whole life long or is it more since you’ve 
been up here?”
Dick: “Well working as a mechanic, you know, and getting the equipment 
going and keeping it going you know, when you haven’t got a lot to work 
with. It gives you the satisfaction of being able to improvise and keep around 
the job, ’cause the boss says you’ve got to go, it’s up to you, figure it out.”

Chapter 9
In the 1977 video produced by the National Park Service, “One Man’s 
Alaska,” Dick said, “The reason I decided to come into more or less full time, 
was in 1965. I was helping a welder pour a babbitt bearing on a crab boat. 
We had a big ladle of molten babbitt metal and pour it in here. And we poured 
in about a cup full. And we looked at a big explosion and all this babbitt metal 
came out, just like snow except it was molten lead. Hit me in the face and hit 
him in the face. And it got in my eyes pretty bad. And, for a short time they 
didn’t know if I was going to see very much. But in three days I went back to 
work. But I couldn’t see very good, especially in my right eye. And I was test-
ing it every night to see if it was improving. And it was several years before 
I recovered completely. I decided I would quit this racket of pouring babbitt 
metal and that sort of thing, and work’n with dirt falling in your eyes from 
under heavy equipment and that and I would go to Twin Lakes and build me 
a cabin and enjoy my eyesight if I had any left.
I can’t say I was ever lonely. I was always busy. I always had something 
going, observations to make or wood to cut or letters to write. It seemed that 
time was short to get everything done.”
August 11, 1990:
So, she [Ester] got with it and I sawed and split, soaked the loose 
saw buck in the lake and improved our two flag display “Old Glory and 
Little Rhody”. 
August 14, 1990:
The flags are always flying and the stove hot, the tea kettle steaming. 
Esther is usually birding on the creek flat. 
March 26, 1991:
I received a clipping stating that American flags are selling at a 
record rate. Everyone should fly the flag every day not just me. 
July 20, 1991:
Patty [Brown] made it home ok and got her load of wood packed to 
the saw buck. Yesterday she had said she got a flag for her station but it 
is a 5 x 8 footer and much to large for her to manage alone. So, I loaned 
her my bright nylon 3 x 5 footer. It will look nice hoisted to the top of 
her antenna pole on the lake end of the cabin. Rigging the flag would be 
her project for the day. 
July 23, 1991:
Breakfast and chores done before Patty said “upper lake? lower 
lake!” She got a few light showers yesterday evening. Her 3 x 5 flag fly-
ing and she climbed the slope behind the cabin to see how it looked and 
pronounced it pretty nice. It will be company for Patty. I doubt if she 
 409
Repairing with Zeal
could be happy if she had no one to talk to for a month. She was coming 
up this morning and expected to be here in 11/2 - 2 hours. The lake was 
a white capping down pretty good. “I have a little mail for you” she said. 
She would be going to Port Alsworth and might be there two nights. I 
had a few small chores to do. I wanted to make hooks for her flag lan-
yard so she wouldn’t need to tie and untie from the flag. She would take 
her flag down each evening as I do (if I don’t forget). 
August 10, 1991:
Esther is eager to get at the jam making and started sorting and 
stemming berries. I worked up some drift wood and looked for her 
Rhode Island flag. Just recently I saw it and is it in the cache. Must be 
for I didn’t find it in the cabin. There is that hornets nest in the cache 
too and those little guys don’t take kindly to me being in their house. So 
I don’t know. I reckon I will tell Esther she can crawl in there and look 
for her flag if she wants to fly it. Before I headed up the beach she said 
tomorrow is jam making day, hair washing day and we will look for the 
flag – sounds like a school teacher to me. 
August 11, 1991:
Severe wind is about the only reason not to fly the flag. 
August 12, 1991:
It’s a good bed I am sleeping on. It is level and firm. A real good 
night and because I did my writing last night I was free to build a fire, 
heat water and take a bath before going down. The stove is still the little 
eager beaver I remember. It doesn’t take much to have a hot stove in a 
few minutes. I got down to Esther’s dig-gins by way of the beach and 
wondered how come no flags were flying. I had found her Rhode Island 
flag in a box on the lower bunk yesterday afternoon. I asked her how 
come no flags and got accused of sabotaging the fire building material. 
She couldn’t get the stove going and didn’t have time to raise the flags – 
so we did first thing. 
August 16, 1991:
Before I closed my eyes I wondered what tomorrow would bring. 
I didn’t dream that it would be the latest breakfast dishes ever. After 
reveille I put together an army cot for my next sleeping quarters in the 
Weisser cabin. May only spend one night there and can then move 
back to my cabin for Esther will be gone. When I went down she was 
out front stuffing the robbers. I said “what’s new?” “You didn’t take the 
flags down last night” was her reply. Taking care of the flag, wood and 
water is squaws work but it is me who does it. Any way I figured she had 
improved a bit but not a lot. 
August 17, 1991:
She [Ester] wrote in my guest book, told me she had a wonderful 
time, gave me a big hug and climbed into the flying machine. Six, seven 
times she has been here to eat my hotcakes. So she flew away down the 
lake and I soon took down the Rhode Island flag. 
June 14, 1992: Flag day.
The calendar said this was flag day so I ran up my new and very col-
orful nylon 3 x 5' Old glory. Esther’s white and gold Rhode Island flag 
was in the box too but it shows so much white it looks like a white flag 
of surrender. Don’t tell Esther or the Italian in her will explode. 
May 14, 1994:
I came within sight of the cabin and saw that things were not 
right. Torn up cardboard boxes along the path to the lake. Closer I saw 
my good styrofoam egg locker box was broken badly. The one table 
was cleared of everything. By now I decided it was a bear that did it. I 
opened the door and found the east window had been broken. Not just 
pushed in. It was shattered as if struck hard. Glass on the far side of the 
carpet. I would have some cleaning up to do before I called it a day. I 
went out and up the beach until I saw tracks. It was bear alright and a 
pretty big track. An eight footer, I judged. No glass so I used cardboard 
to plug the opening. Mosquitoes had moved in. A fire going, hot water 
for a mini bath. A bite to eat and a quarter till one when I climbed the 
ladder. 	
Now all I needed was for some critter probably a bear to find my 
precious egg supply in the tree and Esther’s box which lifted like cook-
ies and scads of them. I judged the bear had stopped by maybe two 
days ago. Would he make a return visit? I thought not for it appeared 
he hadn’t found anything to eat. Lots of blueberry jam in glass but no 
broken jars. Ham in the cooler box but it was undisturbed. I was very 
fortunate not to have suffered more damage. Almost forgot – the bruin 
broke about 6 inches from the top of my flag pole.

Although Dick Proenneke lived many miles from his near-
est neighbor he was far from being a hermit and enjoyed 
visitors. Dick journaled about many people not included 
in this book. The journal entries included in this book tell 
the story of his handcrafted life. These character sketches 
are meant to give the reader a better understanding of the 
people mentioned and their relationship to Dick. Where 
I could find them, I included dates of birth and death for 
those close to Dick’s generation.
The character sketches are edited from Dick’s journals, 
paraphrased from the footnotes of the five books of Dick’s 
journals, edited by John Branson and memory.
Bob Acheson (1908-1993) was a storekeeper in 
Kodiak, Alaska, who, with his wife, Betty, pur-
chased Spike and Hope Carrithers’ two cabins on 
Twin Lakes. These cabins became the property of 
the National Park Service when Lake Clark National 
Park was created because neither the Carrithers nor 
the Achesons owned the land on which their cabins 
sat. Bob and Betty, along with their children Carolyn, 
Jill, Beth, Rob and Judy, were friends of Dick. That 
friendship continued with their visits to their cabins 
on Twin Lakes. Jill Acheson and Rob Acheson, along 
with their families, have visited Twin Lakes several 
times since Dick left and K. and I have appreciated 
their stories of Dick. Jill and Rob sometimes volun-
teered as tour guides at Dick’s cabin.
Glen Alsworth Sr. and Patty Alsworth started 
Lake Clark Air, with offices in Anchorage and Port 
Alsworth, and the Farm Lodge for visitors’ lodging in 
Port Alsworth. Glen continues to provide air service 
between Anchorage and many bush communities, 
including Port Alsworth. Glen was the youngest son 
of Babe and Mary Alsworth. 
Character Sketches  
Glen Alsworth Jr. is the youngest child of Glen Sr. 
and Patty Alsworth. Glen is a bush pilot and with his 
wife, Lelya, operates the float plane division of Lake 
Clark Air and the Farm Lodge. When Glen Jr. first 
flew to Twin Lakes Dick wrote his name as “Glenny.”
Leon R. Alsworth III is the son of “Lonnie” Alsworth 
and Martha Bedell Alsworth. Leon was a bush pilot 
for Lake Clark Air in the late 1980s before becom-
ing a pilot/ranger for Lake Clark National Park and 
Preserve. Most of the Alaskan bush pilots I have 
flown with since my first flight with Jay Hammond in 
1965 were exceptional pilots. When flying with Leon 
I feel like the plane is an extension of him – his excep-
tionalism stands out.
Leon “Babe” Reid Alsworth (1910-2004) and Mary 
née Griechen Alsworth (1924-1996). Babe was a pio-
neering Alaskan bush pilot and hunting guide. He 
began flying in the Bristol Bay country in 1939. He 
and Mary moved to Lake Clark in 1942 and home-
steaded on the west side of Hardenberg Bay in 1944. 
As the small community grew it became the town of 
Port Alsworth – a hub for air travel into southwest 
Alaska, and home to hunting and fishing lodges, as 
well as the field headquarters for Lake Clark National 
Park. Mary was a postmistress and weather reporter, 
and ran a lodge in Port Alsworth for many years. 
Their children, by age, are, “Lonnie,”  “Bee,”  “Sis,” 
John and Glen Sr.
Leon “Lonnie” R. Alsworth Jr. was the oldest son of 
Babe and Mary Alsworth. Lonnie tragically died in a 
plane crash in 1969.
Sig Rodney Alsworth was the younger son of “Lonnie” 
Alsworth and Martha Bedell Alsworth. Tragically, 
Sig died in a plane crash in 1982.
Wayne “Bee” Alsworth and Betty Roehl Alsworth. 
Bee is the second son of “Babe” and Mary Alsworth. 
He is an exceptional aircraft mechanic and a fixed-
wing aircraft and helicopter pilot. Betty, who was 
married to “Bee” when Dick wrote his journals, is one 
of many who so thoughtfully looked after their wil-
derness neighbor, Dick.
G. Ray Arnett was the assistant secretary of the inte-
rior. He was in charge of the National Parks and 
National Wildlife Refuges during President Ronald 
Regan’s first term, 1981-1984.	
Steve 
Bairieau, 
who 
lived 
in 
Phillipston, 
Massachusetts, visited Dick in 1989.
Andrew “Andy” Balluta (1930-2011) was born and 
raised on Lake Clark. He was the first Alaska Native 
National Park Service ranger in Alaska, working for 
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. He co-au-
thored, with anthropologist Linda Ellanna, the 
1992 book, “Nuvendaltin Quht’ana: The People of 
Nondalton,” and he authored “Shtutda’ina Da’a Sheł 
Qudeł: My Forefathers are Still Walking with Me.”
Andy and two other mushers created a lifelong 
memory for me in 1971 when I was taking care of 
Jay and Bella Hammond’s homestead on Miller 
Creek for the winter. The homestead was miles from 
the next winter resident. Late one morning in below-
zero conditions I looked up to see a line of sleds and 
dogs far out on the white vastness of the frozen lake. 
They were traveling straight to where I was chop-
ping wood. Andy, Tony Balluta and likely Johnny 
Kankaton each had a team of 10 huskies. They had 
departed Nondalton, Alaska, 33 miles to the west and 
had another 13 miles to go before reaching the east 
end of Lake Clark and beyond where they hoped to 
“catch” a moose. After taking a break to warm up and 
enjoy a snack, Andy broke trail through the deep and 
crusted snow. I had never seen three men traveling by 
dog sled and camping out in the middle of the winter 
to bring meat back for their village. 
John Branson, Lake Clark National Park histo-
rian, told me it was his understanding that when dog 
mushing was replaced with snow machines, Johnny 
Kankaton was the last Dena’ina from Nondalton to 
go out in the bush with mushing dogs in about 1977.
Bob Barnett (1915-2009) was a close friend to Bob 
Acheson. He and his wife, Bernadine (1914-2012), 
were some of the first summer residents on Lake 
Clark in the 1950s. Bob Barnett was a businessman in 
Anchorage before moving to Homer.
Bea and Hahns (last name unknown) visited from 
Germany in February 1981.
Frank Bell (1901-1992) was a trapper who built three 
cabins in the late 1950s and early 1960s. One was at 
Snipe Lake; another was on the Chilikadrotna River 
one mile below Lower Twin Lakes; and the third was 
on Upper Twin Lakes. 
Lucy Benjamin was born and raised in Primrose, 
Iowa. She retired from the military and was living in 
Florida when she visited Dick at Twin Lakes.
Alan and Laurel Bennett. Alan was Lake Clark 
National Park and Preserve’s first biologist. For 13 
years he served as a wildlife biologist, fisheries biol-
ogist and program manager for inventory and moni-
toring. Laurel spent 10 years working for Lake Clark 
National Park and Preserve as a biological technician, 
part-time cultural resources technician and an aquatic 
ecologist for the inventory and monitoring program. 
They wrote and edited “Dick Proenneke: Reflections 
on a Man in his Wilderness,” a collection of reflec-
tions contributed by Dick’s friends.
Alan and Laurel volunteered as tour guides at 
Dick’s cabin for six summers during the month of 
August. Their service provided K. and me a break 
from the responsibilities of being there seven days a 
week. We learned from their friendship with Dick 
and from their biological knowledge.  
Alan was on the receiving end of Dick’s two-way 
radio transmissions with the National Park Service 
headquarters for years. Alan held every listener’s atten-
tion when he quoted Dick’s words and humor; his voice 
was a good stand-in for Dick’s voice. Alan said when 
Dick called in, park staff gathered around the radio.
Cheryl Bloethe (Linder) was the first female seasonal 
ranger at the Lower Twin Lakes ranger cabin start-
ing in 1983. She later became an attorney. Cheryl is a 
board member for the nonprofit foundation Friends of 
Dick Proenneke and Lake Clark National Park.

Character Sketches
John Branson first came to Lake Clark in 1974, as 
caretaker and log builder at Jay and Bella Hammond’s 
homestead. He became friends with Dick. The two 
often hiked and canoed together. In 1990 John started 
working for Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. 
As the park historian, he tirelessly gave historical talks, 
talked to elders, collected photographs and other doc-
uments, and edited 13 historical books on the people 
and industries of southwest Alaska. His books docu-
ment the monumental changes that took place across 
southwestern Alaska during the 20th century. His 
books include a five-volume series of Dick’s journals.
Patty Brown became a friend of Dick as a seasonal 
ranger at the Lower Twin Lakes ranger cabin in 
1990 and 1991. Patty then became a school teacher 
in southeast Alaska. She plays a part in the video 
“Alaska Silence and Solitude” by Bob Swerer.
Esther Caporelli (1928-2016) was a retired school 
teacher from Rhode Island who visited Dick several 
times in the 1980s.
Gail “Spike” Hemphill Carrithers (~1898-1982) and 
Hope Carrithers (~1908-2002) built a cabin on Twin 
Lakes about 1962 as a hunting cabin. Dick referred to 
this cabin as the “main cabin.” Now it’s called Spike’s 
Cabin. Dick and Spike built a slightly smaller cabin 
in 1966 or 1967, and Dick referred to it as the “guest 
cabin.” It is now referred to as Hope’s Cabin. 
At the urging of Raymond Proenneke I spoke 
to Hope by phone in February 2002, the year of her 
death. Raymond sent Hope the photos I had sent to 
Raymond and Dick of my restoration of Spike’s and 
Hope’s cabins. At the time Hope was still living alone 
in Spokane, Washington. During our call she said, “I 
can’t wait until it warms up so I can plant my garden.” 
Hope was an inspiration, reminding me to be active 
in body and spirit.
Jim Chaplin was a pilot for Lake Clark Air.
Daniel Clum is the son of Voight Clum and Margaret 
“Sis” Alsworth Clum. He flew for Lake Clark Air and 
other flying services out of Merrill Field in Anchorage. 
Margaret “Sis” Alsworth Clum is the daughter of 
“Babe” and Mary Alsworth.
Larry Collins was a superintendent for the National 
Park Service in California at the time he visited Dick 
in 1989.
Craig Corey is a long-time resident of Lake Clark. He 
was a professor of music at the University of Alaska 
Anchorage. Craig is also a master log builder.
Fred Cowgill (1895-1962) was a WWI veteran and 
hunting guide from Homer, Alaska, who built a cabin 
on Twin Lakes in the late 1950s. The cabin is across 
Hope Creek from where Dick would later build his 
cabin. During the late 1940s and early 1950s Fred, 
along with fellow Homer-based big-game guides 
Guy Waddell and Hugh Watson, flew clients to Twin 
Lakes to hunt. Fred Cowgill created a campsite near 
the mouth of Hope Creek before he built his cabin. 
That campsite has been used ever since and has gradu-
ally increased in size. It is the only hardened campsite 
in the Twin Lakes region. 
Jonny De Razingo helped Dick salvage a 32'-fishing 
boat on Kodiak Island that was washed inland during 
the tsunami that followed the 1964 earthquake in 
Alaska.
Christina “Chris” Degeneres owned Windsong 
Lodge across Twin Lakes with her husband Gary 
Titus. Dick journals about Christina’s sister, Laurie, 
who was a canoe champion in North Carolina.
Hugo Dietrich (1928-) was an aircraft mechanic for 
Wein Consolidated Airline in Anchorage and taught 
aviation at University of Alaska Anchorage. He was a 
mountaineer, river rafter and friend of Dick. 
Laddy and Glenda Elliott are the parents of Patty 
Alsworth. They helped Patty and Glen Alsworth Sr. 
establish Lake Clark Air and the Farm Lodge. Laddy 
was a log builder and jack-of-all-trades. Glenda was 
one of many people who consistently sent all sorts of 
delicious edibles to Dick.
Bob Emerson (1920-2001), a Coast Guard officer 
based on Kodiak Island, knew Dick, as well as Spike 
and Hope Carrithers, and Roy Allen. A creek on Twin 
Lakes where Bob hunted sheep during the late 1950s 
and 1960s became known as Emerson Creek. Local

Dena’ina historically hunted this same creek which 
they called Ts’izdlen or “flows straight.” Ts’izdlen 
likely refers to its striking visual feature within a series 
of waterfalls where the creek rushes perfectly straight 
for a distance, the water held in a channel of granite.
Marshal Farmer (1920-2001) came to Alaska in 1948. 
He was a pilot and big-game guide who purchased 
Fred Cowgill’s cabin on Twin Lakes about 1960. 
After multiple owners the cabin sold to Erv and Linda 
Terry in 1976.
Lee Fink came to Lake Clark as a land surveyor for 
the Bureau of Land Management in 1983. He took 
flying lessons from Babe Alsworth and flew for Lake 
Clark Air. Later he was chief ranger/pilot for Lake 
Clark National Park and Preserve. Lee was another 
park employee who enjoyed sharing his version of 
Dick’s radio calls into headquarters.
Karen Forsythe lived in Anchorage. She was part of 
the 18-member Mountaineering Club of Alaska that 
hiked from Portage Lake to Twin Lakes in 1984. She 
was a friend and hiked with Dick.
Ed Fortier (1917-2001) was an editor at Alaska 
Northwest Publishing Company and was instru-
mental in the publishing of “One Man’s Wilderness,” 
written by Sam Keith.
Jeff Fortner was a young man from Tennessee who 
sent Dick a hunting knife he made in 1981.
Carl and Marge Fraser: Carl was a pilot and Alaska 
State Trooper who visited and corresponded with Dick.
Ralph Gatano was a big-game guide from the Kenai 
Peninsula in Alaska. He owned a cabin on Hardenberg 
Bay in the mid-1960s. He built a plywood hunting 
cabin on Lower Twin Lakes in 1967 that ultimately 
blew apart. The National Park Service removed the 
debris.
Terry (1909-1985) and Victoria “Vic” Gill (1908-
2004) owned a placer gold mining operation and cabin 
in Bonanza Hills, 35 miles west of Dick’s cabin. Their 
mine was operational from 1958 until 1985. On sev-
eral occasions Dick hiked the distance to visit or work 
on their bulldozer or build a cabin. The gold nuggets 
Dick photographed came from his visits to their mine.
Pete Guzman visited Twin Lakes in 1996. He 
met Dick, hiked in Hope Creek and stayed in the 
Vanderpool Cabin.
Dick Hackard, Dick’s nephew, visited  Dick in 1969 
when he finished high school. He is the son of Dick’s 
older sister Lorene Proenneke Hackard (1913-2008) 
and Melvin Hackard. Dick Hackard is a founding 
board member for the Friends of Dick Proenneke and 
Lake Clark National Park. He was instrumental in 
starting the Dick Proenneke Endowment that, when 
fully funded, will help the National Park Service with 
restorations, seasonal interpretative staffing and more, 
for Dick’s cabin and Twin Lakes.
Paul Haertel was the first superintendent of Lake 
Clark National Park and Preserve, from 1981 to 1987. 
Hank Haertel is Paul Haertel’s son.
Doris Hagedorn and Florence Hicks were mission-
aries for Arctic Missions at the Dena’ina village of 
Nondalton from 1965 to 1988. Dick sometimes wrote 
“The Mission Girls,” a reference first used by Babe 
Alsworth. 
Jay (1922-2005) and Bella Hammond (1932-
2020)  homesteaded  at Miller Creek on Lake Clark 
shortly after they were married in 1952. After serving 
as a Marine Corps fighter pilot in WWII, Jay moved 
to Alaska in 1946,  working as bush pilot and with 
the federal predator control program. In 1959, when 
Alaska became a state, Jay was elected as the repre-
sentative from southwest Alaska and was then elected 
to the Alaska State Senate where he presided as senate 
president. He also served as the mayor of the Bristol 
Bay Borough. As a moderate Republican, Jay served 
as governor of Alaska from 1974 to 1982, supporting 
major environmental protections.  When he wasn’t 
involved with politics, Jay flew as an air taxi pilot and 
was a big game and fishing guide. Jay and Bella also 
fished commercially for salmon in Bristol Bay. 
Bella was a vocal supporter  of wilderness and 
wildlife protection. She was an inspiration to me 
about protecting wolves and other wild creatures. 
Bella was a founding member of the Friends of Dick

Proenneke and Lake Clark National Park. In the 
1980s and beyond, she and Jay were early supporters 
of the new Lake Clark National Park. In 2018, the 2.6 
million acre wilderness within Lake Clark National 
Park and Preserve was named the Jay S. Hammond 
Wilderness Area.
Heidi Hammond is Jay and Bella Hammond’s daugh-
ter and  has been a commercial fisherwoman since 
childhood. Heidi continues to fish each summer at the 
mouth of the Naknek River with her children, Lauren 
and Jay, and works as an environmental consultant for 
the rest of the year in Anchorage and King Salmon. 
Heidi has spent a lot time at her parents’ Lake Clark 
homestead and has fond memories of trips with her 
dad to visit Dick at Twin Lakes.
Chuck Hewett and Fred Ubanks were both National 
Park Service employees who visited Dick in 1976 
during the planning of the new Lake Clark National 
Monument.

John Kauffmann (1923-2014) was a National Park 
Service writer and planner. In 1974 he worked with 
Dick on Dick’s film and photographs for the National 
Park Service. The NPS’s resulting film, “One Man’s 
Alaska,” was used to encourage the inclusion of a vast 
wilderness of lake country, including Twin Lakes, 
into the new Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.
Sam Keith (1921-2003) was an educator and school 
administrator from Massachusetts. He and Dick 
became friends in Kodiak, Alaska, in the 1950s. 
While visiting Dick at Twin Lakes, Sam told Dick he 
thought Dick’s journals were publishable. Dick asked 
Sam if he could turn them into a book, which became 
“One Man’s Wilderness.”  
Dick was upset that Sam did not stick exactly to 
the words in Dick’s journals. For example, Sam used 
the phrase “boss hunter” to describe Marshal Farmer. 
Dick never wrote “boss hunter.” Dick spoke to me 
about his displeasure with Sam’s editing and para-
phrasing words in his journal when I visited in 1982.
“One Man’s Wilderness” quickly became a classic, 
making a legend of Dick’s life and the wilderness of 
Twin Lakes. Dick only journaled with pride for how 
the story of his life was appreciated by so many. The 
book was later sold in a Japanese translation.
Jergen “Jerg” Kroener was a young German man who 
spent three months at Twin Lakes in 1974 hiking and 
photographing. Dick thought highly of Jerg’s photog-
raphy abilities. When he departed Twin Lakes, Jerg 
left much of his camping gear for Dick,  including 
an orange two-person tent that Dick used for the 
remainder of his time at Twin Lakes. The tent resides 
on Dick’s lower bunk to this day.
Dennis Knuckles was a ranger and pilot for Lake 
Clark National Park and Preserve during the last 
years Dick lived on Twin Lakes.
Mark and Sandy Lang. Mark is a bush pilot. He and 
Sandy operate a hunting and fishing lodge in Port 
Alsworth, Alaska. Sandy was postmistress for 20 years 
beginning in 1982. Since 2012 they have been a part 
of “Operation Heal Our Patriots – Samaritans Purse,” 
which flies groups of wounded warriors to visit Dick’s 
cabin each week when the weather permits.
Vernon “Bud” Lenne Lofstedt (1922-2016). In the 
early 1950s Bud and his wife, Ruth Christensen, 
moved to Kenai where Bud started both airplane and 
helicopter flying services. He had a log hunting cabin 
constructed on the delta at the upper end of Twin 
Lakes in the 1960s.
Maud was a friend of Dick’s sister, Helen Proenneke.
Bill McGee as pilot, along with his daughter, Katie 
McGee as cook, operated a flying service that toured 
various Alaskan destinations, providing camping and 
fishing excursions for tourists. Katie always left their 
extra food with Dick so he made a kitchen knife for 
her.
Merrick “Whitey” Rea Mohr (1920-2009) was a 
businessman from Seattle and friend of Dick.
Lael Morgan was a writer and historian. She was 
chief writer of the Bristol Bay Basin for the Alaska 
Geographic Society in 1978.
Margaret “Mardy” E. Murie (1902-2003) grew up in 
Fairbanks, Alaska. In 1924 she was the first woman to 
graduate from the University of Alaska. The day after 
she and the young biologist Olaus Murie married 
in August 1924, they set out on a 550-mile journey 
by dog sled and boat down the Koyukuk River and 
through the Brooks Range. Their eight-month honey-
moon/scientific expedition is part of Mardy’s memoir, 
“Two in the Far North,” an Alaskan classic. 
Considered Grandmother of the Conservation move- 
ment, she and Dick were kindred spirits in wilderness 
preservation. In 1998 she was awarded the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton.
Dr. Daniel O’Connell lived in Dillingham, Alaska. 
He hunted in the Emerson Creek area and knew 
Dick. Dick occasionally referred to the Vanderpool 
cabin near Emerson creek as the O’Connell Cabin.
Steve Pasniak, from Washington, met Dick in 1981 
when he flew by Twin Lakes on his way to salvaging a 
Cessna 206 west of the Bonanza Hills.
Gary Pogany was a big-game guide and lodge owner 
at Port Alsworth.
Florence Proenneke (1918-2003) was Dick’s younger 
418

sister. She lived at the Proenneke home in Primrose, 
Iowa, most of her life. She worked for Sheaffer Pen 
Company during WWII. Dick used Sheaffer ink 
almost exclusively to write his journals.
Helen Proenneke (1912-2003) was Dick’s oldest sister. 
She worked at the Mars Candy Bar Co. in Chicago.
Raymond “Jake” Proenneke (1923-2014) was the 
youngest of the three Proenneke brothers. He worked 
as a mechanical inspector in machine shops and in the 
aerospace industry. Jake repaired aircraft instruments, 
was a private pilot and glider pilot, and  was a master 
at rebuilding small airplanes. Raymond made numer-
ous trips north to visit his brother on Twin Lakes. 
Suggesting Dick film himself building his cabin, he 
purchased the Bolex 8mm that Dick used and later 
gave Dick a 16mm Bolex movie camera. In 2000, 
Raymond opened his home to his older brother as 
Dick’s health failed.
Robert and Dorothy Proenneke were Dick’s older 
brother and sister-in-law. They lived in Virginia.
Ginny Ressler worked for the National Park Service. 
Fred Hirschmann, Cheryl Bloethe and Dick 
Proenneke slept on the carpet of Ginny’s apartment 
on their way down the Alaska Highway in 1983.

from the Kenai Peninsula where he worked in the 
construction trades.
Jim Shake was a young visitor from Washington who 
wished to live on Twin Lakes for a period of time. 
He briefly purchased Spike and Hope’s cabins before 
backing out. He wasn’t comfortable staying in the wil-
derness. When he departed he left some of his gear 
for Dick.
John C. Smith was the manager for Northern 
Insurance Adjustors when he commented on the value 
of Dick’s J-3 cub.
Ted Stevens (1923–2010) was a United States Senator 
between 1968 and 2009.

lumberyard and building-supply business in Kodiak 
from 1945 to 1980, when he sold it to his children.
Gail Taylor was from Bettendorf, Iowa. She visited 
Dick in 1980 while fishing in Alaska.
Erv Terry was a real estate broker from Anchorage 
who, in the 1970s, purchased two cabins on Twin 
Lakes. These were the only deeded parcels on Twin 
Lakes, both 5 acres – the Jerre Wills Cabin and the 
Cowgill-Farmer Cabin.
Gary Titus and his wife, Christina “Chris” Degeneres, 
were from Sterling, Alaska. In 1987 they purchased 
Jerre Wills’ cabin across Twin Lakes from Erv Terry. 
They constructed three prefabricated log cabins and 
started Windsong Lodge. Gary was a law-enforce-
ment officer, historian, writer and restorer of historic 
cabins for the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.
Bob and Mary Trask were from Bellevue, Washington. 
They were part of a group of hikers at Twin Lakes in 1984.

1963. In the 1970s he was a pilot for the National 
Park Service, conducting aerial counts of moose, car-
ibou and sheep as part of the proposed Lake Clark 
National Monument. Larce was a school teacher and 
real estate agent.
Hollis and Pam Twitchell were friends of Dick. Hollis 
was a ranger/pilot for Lake Clark National Park and 
Preserve from 1981 to 1990. They were the first staff 
of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve to live in 
Port Alsworth, Alaska.
Olin Twitchell is the son of Pam and Hollis Twitchell.
Dave Tyson was a fishing guide who spent summers 
at Port Alsworth. He and his wife, Debbie Tyson, 
had a permanent home in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Fred Ubanks and Chuck Hewett were both National 
Park Service employees who visited Dick in 1976 
during the planning of the new Lake Clark National 
Monument.
Lewis “Buster” Vanderpool (1934-1999) and friends 
from Lime Village built an 11' x 12' cabin near a 
creek about 1960 as a base for hunting sheep in the 
Twin Lakes area. The cabin was most often called 
 419
Character Sketches
the Vanderpool Cabin but sometimes called the 
O’Connell cabin. It was accidentally burned down by 
backpackers in 1997.
Glen and Sharon Van Valen were school teachers 
in villages in western Alaska in the late 1960s. They 
built and operated the Island Lodge on Lake Clark 
in the 1980s. Jack Ross constructed the lodge. Sharon 
became a long-term teacher in Portage, Alaska.
William L. Vaughan, from Elm Hill Farm in 
Hallowell, Maine, sent Dick a crooked knife blade via 
John Kauffmann in 1976.
Jana Walker was the seasonal ranger stationed at 
the Lower Twin Lakes cabin during the last years 
of Dick’s time at Twin Lakes. She and Dick became 
close friends.
Walter Ward, Candice “Candy” Downing and 
Beatrice Van Horn met Dick Proenneke at Twin 
Lakes in 1974, as undergraduate students from 
the University of California, Santa Cruz in the 
Environmental Studies Program funded by a Sierra 
Club Foundation grant. They were studying the fea-
sibility of national park status for the country around 
Lake Clark. When Candice Ward and Walter mar-
ried the following year, Dick sent a carved spoon and 
bowl. They created the Walter & Candice Ward’s out-
door store in Soldotna, Alaska. Dick named Beatrice 
Creek for Beatrice Van Horn.
Erhardt “Dick” Weisser began sport hunting in 
the Twin Lakes country in 1957. He was a friend of 
Dick and the Carrithers. He lived in Kodiak where 
he was a contractor at the Kodiak Naval Station. He 
built a cabin near Carrithers’ main cabin in 1967. He 
finished the cabin but then did not return to Twin 
Lakes. When I restored the cabin’s roof in 2001, I 
removed the large pile of wood chips he had left in 
one corner during the cabin’s construction.
Randy Weisser is the son of Dick Weisser. He and 
Dick helped Randy’s father build the Weisser cabin.
Helen White (1905-1994) was a naturalist and writer/
editor for Alaska Northwest Publishing Co. and a 
close friend of Dick. She played an important role 
in Dick’s life as the person who provided him with 
notebooks. After a notebook was filled, Dick sent it 
to Helen to read and pass on to the next Proenneke 
friend. Eventually they arrived at the home of Dick’s 
brother “Jake” who read and kept them. In 2000, Dick 
and Raymond gave 119 pounds of Dick’s handwritten 
journals to the National Park Service.
Wavel Wilkinson (1901-1994) and Frank Wilkinson 
(1885-1957) owned the ranch in Heppner, Oregon, 
where Dick worked in the late 1930s and early 1940s. 
Shirley Wilkinson Rugg (1929-) is the daughter of 
Wavel and Frank Wilkinson.
Jerre Wills (1936-) was a commercial fisherman from 
Homer, Alaska. He built a cabin at “Whitefish Point,” 
across Twin Lakes from Dick’s cabin, in 1968. He 
later purchased three cabins in the Twin Lakes area 
from Frank Bell.
Alison Woodings met Dick Proenneke as the cook 
at Mark and Sandy Lang’s lodge in Port Alsworth, 
Alaska, and later visited Dick at Twin Lakes.
Herb Wright was a friend of Dick’s from Kodiak, 
Alaska. He hunted from a shoreline base camp on 
Lower Twin Lakes before planning to build a cabin 
on Upper Twin Lakes. When cancer ended those 
plans he suggested to Dick to build on that site near 
Hope Creek.
“Big” John Yourkowski was one of Dick’s friends who 
was on a 1953 brown bear hunt on Kodiak along with 
Sam Keith and Marion “Mac” McCullough.
Kathy Yourkowski was the daughter of John 
Yourkowski.
Maggie Yurick was a friend of Dick’s and backcoun-
try ranger for Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. 
She drowned in a freak accident while walking her 
pet dog.

I wish to thank Dick Proenneke for his purposeful 
life at Twin Lakes, his friendship, and his handcraft, 
photography, movie film and journals, which he wrote 
for all of us.
No one were closer partners to K. and me than 
Dan Molina and Jennifer Jones Molina, who volun-
teered at the Lower Twin Lakes ranger cabin for the 
last 16 summers we were caretakers at Dick’s cabin. 
At the start of each summer K. and I stayed in their 
home in Wasilla for a few days before being flown out 
to Twin Lakes. We boxed the entirety of our summer’s 
food and the materials I needed for projects at Dick’s 
cabin in their garage. At Twin Lakes when K. and I 
got days off the four of us either explored the dozens 
of drainages that make up the Twin Lakes basin or, 
year after year, documented the wildlife in the same 
15 square miles of wilderness along the Chilikadrotna 
River. Dan and Jennifer boated to assist K. and me at 
Dick’s cabin too many times to count.
In 2000 the National Park Service learned that 
Dick would not be returning to his cabin. John 
Branson, historian for Lake Clark National Park, 
asked me to consult with the park about the resto-
ration of Dick’s cabin. I returned to Dick’s cabin for 
the first time since my visit in 1982. 
John Branson worked closely with me on the 
early restorations of Dick’s cabin, cache and wood-
shed, along with the restoration of Spike’s and Hope’s 
cabins. I learned much about Dick from John during 
those times. Throughout the writing of this book, he 
enthusiastically answered dozens of questions I asked 
about the people mentioned in Dick’s journals. John 
also asked K. to watch over Dick’s cabin that first 
summer – that is how K. and I met.
For the next 19 years visitors, pilots and guides 
added to my knowledge of Dick’s life. K. and I initially 
Acknowledgments  
volunteered because of our reverence for Dick but we 
returned all those years because visitors told us how 
much our presence added to their experience. I am 
so grateful to them for their constant appreciation for 
what we added. I was often asked what would happen 
to all I had learned when I no longer returned and I 
finally realized that it was my responsibility to share 
my knowledge in this book.
There are far too many visitors, pilots and guides 
who deserve to be thanked than this page can accom-
modate. A few include Glen Alsworth Jr., Carlin 
Voran, Jeff Duck and other staff with Lake Clark 
Air; Wrangel Jensen and other staff with Trail Ridge 
Air; Dan Oberlatz, Haley Johnson and other guides 
with Alaska Alpine Adventures; and Mark Lang, 
John Erickson, Elizabeth Leigh and other staff with 
Samaritans Purse.
Some of the individuals I want to thank include Bill 
and Connie Markis, Rob and Louise Acheson, Philip 
and Jan Marshall, Jill Acheson, Bob and Rob Gillam 
and their pilot J. B, Heidi Kaufman, Jacqui Lown, John 
Wunsch, Alvin Pierce and Martin Kviteng. 	
I want to especially thank Jeanne Schaaf, retired 
cultural resources program manager for Lake Clark 
National Park. Jeanne supervised and supported my 
restoration of Dick’s cabin and the many replications I 
made of his handcrafted artifacts. Without her confi-
dence and support in my work, Dick’s cabin would not 
have been cared for as visitors find it today, nor would 
I have been able to write this book.	
Jeanette Mills undertook the Herculean effort of 
transcribing some 119 pounds of Dick’s handwritten 
journals for the Lake Clark National Park. Jeanette 
and her husband Jerry were close friends of Dick’s. 
Their personal support and helping me understand 
what edits Dick would appreciate in the editing of his 
 421
Acknowledgements
journals has felt like Dick was here with me as I wrote. 
It was Kathryn “Katie” Myers, museum curator 
for Lake Clark National Park, who provided me a CD 
of Dick’s entire transcribed journals in 2017. With 
access to this important primary source material, what 
I had already written was discarded and the book took 
its present form. Katie Myers generously made avail-
able the Dick Proenneke photographs entrusted to the 
National Park Service, along with numerous scans of 
Dick’s handwritten journals.  
I also want to thank photographer Fred 
Hirschmann, who took some of the photographs now 
held by the National Park Service and allowed me 
to use other photos of his for this book. I am thank-
ful for other Dick Proenneke photos offered by Bob 
Swerer Jr. (author of “Alone in the Wilderness – The 
Dick Proenneke Photo Album”). I wish to thank Dick 
Hackard, Dick Proenneke’s nephew, for his encour-
agement. I thank Ree Slocum, who offered photo-
graphs and her encouragement as well.
Several people have allowed me to photograph 
or sent me photos of gifts Dick gave to them. They 
include Bella Hammond and her daughter, Heidi 
Hammond, Glenda and Laddy Elliott, Sandy Lang, 
Allison Woodings, John Branson and Jeff Myers. The 
sharing of these gifts felt like a sharing of the time 
they spent with Dick and the admiration they felt for 
their treasured friend.
K. and I shall forever feel honored to have been 
invited by the National Park Service to serve as volun-
teers at the Dick Proenneke Historical Site. Without 
the confidence of three successive superintendents, 
Deb Leggett, Joel Hard and Margaret Goodro, we 
would not have returned year after year. Many other 
National Park Service staff and volunteers  expressed 
heartfelt support of the seven-days-a-week demands 
of our service at the Proenneke cabin. They include 
but are not limited to Alan and Laurel Bennett, Tony 
Perelli and Becky King, Jerry and Jeanette Mills, Don 
and Lynn Welty, Leon Alsworth, Lee Fink, Steve 
Peterson, Page Spencer, Warren Hill, George Alexie, 
Dan Young, Lucas Westcott and Buck Mangipane.
I want to thank Karen Evanoff, cultural anthro-
pologist for the National Park Service, and Adrienne 
Hall, Alaska Wilderness Program Coordinator for 
the National Park Service. They both assisted me with 
the wording of the Land Acknowledgement below.
I thank Dale Vinson, archeologist for Katmai 
National Park, for the title “Cabin Whisperer” he 
bestowed on me after reading my sleuthing report of 
a significant yet very deteriorated historic log cabin in 
Katmai National Park. 
Working with Lost Art Press has been excep-
tional. Chris Schwarz believed in this project as I had 
only dreamed. I give a special thanks to Kara Gebhart 
Uhl for editing the manuscript and for being a sup-
portive collaborator as we created this book. I thank 
Linda Watts. Her artistic skill created the visual feast 
of text, photographs and illustration.
I want to thank my child, Elan Robinson, who 
was present for some of the restorations on Dick’s 
cabin and who accompanied me on many Twin Lakes 
wilderness adventures. Elan has been a continuing 
support to me throughout this book. Their illustra-
tions of Dick’s cabin opened my eyes to what illus-
trations could add. Elan’s editing of the introduction 
and the epilogue added another wonderful level of 
clarity.
Elin Price, thank you for illustrating this book. 
Seeing Elin’s illustrations gives me the heartfelt 
experience I felt absorbing Eric Sloan’s illustrations 
decades ago. 
Lastly, my greatest appreciation is to Kathryn 
Schubeck, for the many months she endured and 
assisted as I obsessed over this project. Having graded 
thousands of papers during her years as a teacher, it 
was her editing that made this book what it became. 
K. was continuously my greatest supporter. She spent 
many weeks working 10 or more hours a day, and 
when I worked alone, she took care of me. Her belief 
in this book kept me going when I needed it most. 
When K. was giving a tour at Twin Lakes and a 
visitor wanted to know more about Dick’s handcraft, 
she would call me on the walkie-talkie. But it was she 
who met most visitors. As a teacher, K. helped each 
of her students reach their potential. She connected 
with visitors at Dick’s cabin similarly, giving them the 
knowledge and space they needed to relate to Dick’s 
life for the same reasons they were drawn to his cabin 
in the first place.

During our last years at Twin Lakes, several pilots 
spoke of K.’s love of being at Dick’s evidenced by 
hearing as much enthusiasm in her interpretive talks 
as when they first listened to her tour 18 years earlier. 
Returning to Twin Lakes year after year was K.’s and 
my way of thanking Dick for his effort to preserve the 
wilderness of Twin Lakes. For me, returning to Twin 
Lakes was to hear K.’s spirit sing another year.  
Land Acknowledgement	
I wish to acknowledge local Dena’ina (Athabaskan 
language of the region) use of Twin Lakes country as 
a place they have lived, hunted and traveled for mil-
lennium. Every place I have lived, throughout my 
life, I have found evidence of Indigenous people who 
lived there only a few generations earlier. And always 
I saw evidence of Indigenous cultures living in a self- 
sustaining way with the land. At an impressionable 
age I saw where Chiricahua Apache (also Athabaskan 
linguistically) people grew corn and ground it into 
flour at a long-established village within an old oak 
grove at Chiricahua National Monument. Only a 
few miles away, the dozens of empty cartridges and 
lead bullets I found around Fort Bowie told of the 
force used to remove the Apache from their ancestral 
homeland. I met an old man, a grandchild of one of 
those who was relocated and never allowed to return 
to his homeland. Spending time in nature far from the 
ever-expanding spread and exploitation done by the 
culture I live in, has been my life-long passion. 
In 2002 K. and I camped on the top of a prominent 
knoll a mile from Twin Lakes. As we walked toward 
an enormous glacial erratic boulder that lay on the top 
of the knoll I knew I was walking on ground valued, 
maybe sacred, to Dena’ina people, a place that likely 
had a Dena’ina name. During the following summers 
we returned there to camp for up to two weeks sur-
rounded by migrating herds of caribou and the other 
wildlife that Indigenous people had come here to hunt. 
A ring of lichen-covered stones, almost indiscernible, 
had held a tipi protected by the boulder from strong 
west winds. We placed the part of a projectile and 
a scraper left by these hunters on the granite boul-
der for the days we camped – returning them to the 
place where we found them when we departed. A few 
miles from this knoll, at a unique place that allowed 
Indigenous hunters to wait hidden as migrating car-
ibou passed, our friend Dan Molina found a broken 
projectile point. We learned just how long local hunt-
ers lived across this landscape when an archeologist 
contracted by the National Park Service estimated the 
point was made 6,500 years ago. Every summer while 
standing next to the boulder, K. and I acknowledged 
the significance of this place – of people who have lived 
here for thousands of years in balance with the entire 
community of life that is their homeland.
Wilderness is becoming the last refuge on Earth 
from the sea of extractive humanity. Even though 
Dick Proenneke was a part of the dominant cul-
ture, he modeled a non-consumptive, non-extractive, 
non-exploitive life in nature. Indigenous people lived 
here for centuries and are the first models for living 
with the land in a self-sustaining manner. We all 
have Indigenous roots but many cultures have moved 
far from a self-sustaining relationship with land and 
nature. It is with this background that I find solace in 
Dick Proenneke’s time at Twin Lakes.
 423
In 2000, when it was known Dick would not be 
returning to live at Twin Lakes, there was a lot of 
decision-making concerning what would remain at 
his cabin and the other three cabins up the shoreline. 
Each was filled with Dick’s accumulated belongings. 
The goal was to keep the spirit of Dick present for vis-
itors to see. Jeanne Schaaf, cultural resources program 
manager, along with park historian John Branson, 
were the primary decision makers on what should 
be done with each item. Their priority was moving 
those things most likely to be lost or damaged to the 
archives in Anchorage. Next was stabilizing the struc-
tures rather than letting them deteriorate. Replacing 
the items moved to the archives with similar items 
was not of immediate consideration.
Hearing visitors ask about Dick’s cameras, bin-
oculars, spotting scope and other items stored in the 
archives let us know his cabin lacked some of Dick’s 
spirit. When an identical model of spotting scope 
was purchased to have at his cabin, visitors thrilled 
at watching sheep and bears as Dick had. A comple-
ment of movie cameras, a 35mm camera and telephoto 
lenses, all matching what Dick owned, would bring 
more of Dick back to his cabin. Purchasing a classic 
Griswold rounded-cornered skillet pictured at the end 
of Chapter 4 would complete Dick’s kitchen cookware 
while bringing attention to his beautifully handcrafted 
skillet lid made from a 5-gallon gas can. Moving more 
of Dick’s winter gear, including his spruce skis, to his 
cabin would make tours of Dick’s life more complete. 
Having a nonoperative version of Dick’s rifle hanging 
above his fireplace mantle could even be considered. 
The restoration of the roofs of Dick’s cabin and 
woodshed were completed in 2000. The bottom logs 
of the woodshed and cabin were replaced along with 
the roof restoration and leg replacement on Dick’s 
Epilogue  
cache in 2003. Once those major restorations were 
complete, Jeanne Schaaf initiated my replicating many 
of Dick’s handcrafted items. There was an ongoing 
dialogue about what to replicate and when to bring 
additional items to the archives. With these reproduc-
tions, a full complement of Dick’s handcrafted items 
have been maintained at Twin Lakes.
 The copper caps protecting the exposed, rotted 
ends of Dick’s roof logs are frequently one of the first 
things visitors ask about because they are so visible. 
Visitors often asked if Dick made them. When I 
arrived in 2000 the ends of the ridge log, purlins and 
eve logs had been exposed for 32 years, as were the 
exposed ends of the roof logs of his woodshed. I was

extensions, but I was also given discretion to use my 
best judgement once I was on site.
Once on site both of the prescribed solutions 
seemed extreme and would forever alter Dick’s crafts-
manship in an irreversible way. Dick’s ridge log and 
purlin logs are the three most beautiful, straight and 
knot-free logs in his cabin. Without reading Dick’s 
journals I felt sure Dick would have picked these three 
logs when he was felling trees for the long logs in his 
cabin. When he found a beautiful log just the right 
diameter he would have cut it with the extra length 
needed for these pieces.
I did not think I could find three perfect trees 
without felling more trees than were needed. If I 
replaced the roof logs I would have to select slightly 
larger logs and scribe a new fit through the gable end 
wall logs or my restorative log work would not look as 
tight as his original work. Using slightly larger logs 
would allow me to scribe and match Dick’s log fit but 
would change the scale of Dick’s selection of logs. If I 
replaced the ridge pole and purlins, all of Dick’s rafter 
poles would not fit on these new logs as he had orig-
inally fit them. Splicing new sections of log on the 
ends would be obvious for visitors examining Dick’s 
cabin and also have some of the same issues as replac-
ing the logs. I did not want to take either one of the 
suggested invasive steps to eliminate the rot when it 
was not absolutely needed. 
Being anxious about doing any work on Dick’s 
cabin I started by restoring the roof of his woodshed 
that had the same rotted roof support logs. When I 
asked myself how Dick would have addressed the rot-
ted ends of the exposed ends of the roof logs, given the 
condition they were in, the answer was obvious. There 
was substantial rot at the end of each roof-supporting 
log but only at the top of the log. Structural integrity 
remained at the core of each log. I knew if they were 
left exposed, the rotted section would continue to be 
soaked with rain and the rot would move to the core of 
each log and further along the log’s length within only 
a few years. The rotted wood would hold water, which 
would rot farther into the logs at an accelerating rate. 
If the rot was not stopped it would soon be a structural 
problem. I was sure Dick would have made end caps 
for each roof log to shed rain from getting the log ends 
wet and he would have used 5-gallon gas-can metal to 
make the caps.
On Dick’s woodshed I fabricated loose-fitting 
caps to protect the ends of each roof support log using 
5-gallon gas cans Dick left in his woodshed. Always 
thinking about how to have my work last without 
further invasive restoration, I painted the end caps 
to inhibit rusting. Now having read Dick’s journals, 
I know he also painted many metal items for both 
inside and outdoor use.
I used copper sheeting I brought with me to fab-
ricate end caps on Dick’s cabin since it would last 
much longer than gas-can metal and it would age to 
an unobtrusive patina. As much as I did not like using 
the end caps, they were preferable to destroying Dick’s 
original craftsmanship by replacing the logs. 
The tar paper Dick installed in 1968 was torn 
between Dick’s rafter poles from people and bears 
stepping on the roof. Steve Peterson, head historical 
architect for the National Park Service in Alaska, pro-
vided me with tar paper to replace Dick’s tar paper layer 
as needed. Steve wanted extremely durable EPDM 
(ethylene propylene diene terpolymer) rubber used in 
place of Dick’s polyethylene Visqueen layer over the tar 
paper. In 2000 the sod on Dick’s cabin and woodshed 
roofs was thin and bare in large areas. John Branson, 
park historian, assisted with exposing the roof of 
Copper end cap fabrication on ridge pole. (Photo by Monroe

Epilogue
Dick’s cabin and woodshed down to the rafter poles. 
We replaced Dick’s tar paper layer where it was torn 
then installed the thick EPDM rubber. We cut new 
sod from where the Vanderpool cabin had burned, drug 
it to the beach on tarps and boated it to Dick’s cabin 
using the Lower Twin Lakes motor boat and Dick’s 
Elgin canoe. I was impressed with the increased tough-
ness of EPDM over the Visqueen, but over the years, 
the new tar paper was again torn by black bears walk-
ing on Dick’s cabin roof. A second roof restoration to 
address this problem took place in 2017.
In 2000 the half-log fascia and the exposed raf-
ter poles on both gable ends were rotted so I replaced 
them with new poles replicating Dick’s original work 
as closely as I could. In 2003 I received permission 
from Steve Peterson to fabricate a copper flashing to 
extend the drip line about an inch beyond the half-log 
fascia and gable end rafter poles to add longevity.
I wrote Dick a letter immediately after he 
departed his Twin Lakes home for the last time in 
2000. He started his six-page response to me and 
Elan, “I picked up your letter from our rural box at 
curbside. I had been thinking of you and now I have 
an address. Thank you. 
“I was certainly pleased with the new cabin roof. 
It looks like Monroe Robinson did it and do you plan 
to go again next summer? …
“Monroe, as far as I’m concerned my cabin is your’s 
and the Park Service. All you need is Park Service 
permission to replace or repair. Doubt if Lee or Leon 
would object to anything you want to do. The only 
suggestion I would make is see if you can stop squirrel 
damage to my cabin and cache. Freddy the squirrel, I 
intended to trap and deport. Dennis (Knuckles) fur-
nished the trap. It came time to go and I chickened 
out – let the Park Service deal with it.”
In 2017, Lake Clark National Park hired Al 
Williams, historical log cabin preservationist, to work 
the first 10 days on a second restoration of the roof 
on Dick’s cabin and woodshed. Seasonal park ranger 
Danny Dresher assisted Al and me the first few days. 
When Danny left Tony Perelli, a seasonal craftsman, 
assisted through the end of the project.
For the 2017 restoration Chris Wilcox, chief of 
maintenance for the park, suggested installing a layer 
of plywood over the tar paper even though he knew I 
had spoken many times of not using plywood around 
Dick’s cabin. Dick did not use plywood to make or 
repair things at Twin Lakes. I supported Chris’s sug-
gestion because plywood would keep the tar paper 
from ripping when people or bears walked on the 
roof. To hide the edge of the plywood, I redesigned 
my 2003 perimeter flashing to hide the edge of the 
plywood while still extending the drip line beyond the

Epilogue
half-round fascia and gable end poles that had been 
protected by the earlier flashing. 
In 2017 the copper end caps I fabricated in 2000 
were performing as intended, keeping the ends of the 
roof support logs dry. The level of rot on the top of 
the roof support logs in 2017 was unchanged from 
when I installed them 17 years earlier. Al suggested 
adding a little more space between the log and the 
end cap and they were put back in place. The entire 
restoration was a rewarding collaboration. On Al’s 
last day, he, Tony and I replaced the 5-gallon gas can 
end caps on Dick’s woodshed with ones fabricated 
from copper.
Once Al left, Tony and I completed the resto-
ration of both the cabin and woodshed. Because the 
pole structures sitting on the sod roofs were rotting, 
Tony and I used the rotted ones and the measure-
ments I recorded of Dick’s original pole structure in 
2000 to fabricate new ones as close to Dick’s original 
work as possible.
Youth from the Student Conservation Association, 
led by Warren Hill, cut and hauled additional sod 
from the old Vanderpool cabin site. Dan and Jennifer 
Molina managed the boat transport and assisted the 
SCA crew carrying the sod and lifting it up to the roof 
of Dick’s cabin.

Epilogue
In 2000, when Dick didn’t return to his cabin, the 
legs of his cache were rotted at ground level.  He wrote, 
“Monroe, do you approve of our cache fix? 
They were getting soft below ground, a 
big down lake wind caused the cache to 
list down wind. I pulled it near true and 
Lee [Fink], I & Jana [Walker] added the leg 
extensions. Park Service said they must be 
wood as original. I and Lee feel our repair 
will last longer than new wood all the way.  
I would like your opinion…
“If you do go to Twin Lakes again think of 
me on a hike some time, I packed a pedometer 
for a full year morning till night. For the year 
3,081 miles the total. 
“Have a good day you kids,
“My best, Dick”
The steel posts were keeping the cache from fall-
ing but it was twisting, leaning backward and toward 
the lake. The Park Service asked me to replace the 
cache legs in 2000. I was told Dick built the cache on 
the beach, numbered the logs and then reassembled 
it up on the legs. The suggestion was to disassemble 
the cache, replace the legs and then reassemble it back 
on the legs. After examining Dick’s use of spikes to 
fasten each small wall pole to the one below I thought 
disassembling the cache would destroy the poles. I 
spent two years imagining how to replace the legs 
while leaving the cache in place. 
In 2003 John Branson assisted me in building a 
simple scaffolding with 2" x 6" lumber. We tied the 
cache to trees in each direction with ropes and pulled 
the cache up straight. Using a high-lift jack, we lifted 
one corner at a time about 9" to drop the rotted leg 
free of Dick’s salvaged square aircraft tubing that held 
the legs to the cache. Having one corner of the cache 
lifted looked extreme but a log structure has more flex 
than one would imagine. Once a new leg was in place, 
each corner of the cache with Dick’s salvaged aircraft 
tubing still protruding settled back on the predrilled 
leg to a perfect upright stance. John assisted with the 
first three legs that took only a day to replace. He also 
assisted with the restoration of the cache roof. Warren 
Hill, ranger for the park, assisted with the final leg. 
When complete, I was surprised by the smile I felt 
across my face realizing this was the cache standing as 
Dick had first seen it.
I wanted to give greater longevity to the new legs 
than Dick’s original work. Each of his legs was rotted 
most severely immediately below ground level. Some 
legs had completely rotted free of the below-ground 
section. I wrapped each new leg with a pad satu-
rated in wood preservative (QNAP oil-borne copper 
naphthenate) that was recommended and provided by 
Steve Peterson. Over the QNAP I wrapped a sheet of 
copper that extended two inches above ground level.
I did not want to see Dick’s original cache legs as 
artifacts leaning against a tree behind his woodshed 
and I also did not want to cut them for firewood. I 
wanted the poles to remain in our lives and to show 
them to visitors. The upper end of the cache legs with 
Dick’s original 5-gallon gas can wraps became the legs 
for an outside table at Spike’s cabin where we stayed 
each summer. I ripped a few sections of the poles into 
boards for the table’s top.

Epilogue
logs (sill logs) of Dick’s cabin in 2000. Tree roots had 
grown into the sill logs. They were rotted but the rot 
was not migrating to the next log up so I did not see 
a rush to change them. As with the cache legs I spent 
two years planning how to replace the sill logs iden-
tical to Dick’s original work and to get the job done 
quickly to minimize the number of visitors that might 
be shocked to see Dick’s cabin in this state of disre-
pair. Steve Peterson approved the plan I developed to 
replace the sill logs in 2003. The work took less than 
a week with the assistance of National Park Service 
Historian John Branson, National Park Service 
Maintenance Personnel Bill Trefon, and volunteer 
Jared Fink.  
I took video of replacing the cache legs, replacing 
the sill logs, installing the copper flashing around the 
perimeter of Dick’s cabin and of waxing the hinges of 
Dick’s Dutch door. K. made a DVD of the work done 
in 2003 and gave it to the park.
Because Dick’s rock fireplace was an integral part 
of his cabin we could not jack the cabin up so we began 
by excavating a trench a foot deep around the perim-
eter of the cabin. The cabin was held up on rounds of 
firewood without lifting it more than a fraction of an 
inch. I did not want to sit the new sill logs on a gravel 
base to match Dick’s original work because they 
would then need to be replaced in another three or 
four decades. I bedded 4"-thick solid concrete blocks 
in concrete footings at each corner of Dick’s cabin and 
part way along the walls on which to sit the cabin. A 
layer of tar paper and a QNAP wrap was put between 
the concrete blocks and the new sill logs to keep them 
from rotting. 
I took measurements of the cabin’s elevation and 
the gravel level before starting the sill log replacement. 
The cabin with its new sill logs was placed at exactly 
its original elevation on the concrete blocks. Copper 
strips were nailed to the new sill logs around both the 
inside and outside of the cabin’s perimeter, 1" above 
the original gravel level. Then the cabin perimeter was 
backfilled against the copper to 1" from the top of the 
gravel strip. No gravel or organic material should ever 
touch the new sill logs. A year later, with the new sill 
logs weathered and the copper strips tarnished, the 
restoration was barely noticeable. 
The gravel level along the logs, both inside and 
out, was unchanged from before the restoration. Not 
knowing the particulars of Dick sieving the gravel 
along the paths around his cabin as well as inside until 
I read his journals in 2017, some of the gravel I added 
at the end of the restoration was larger than Dick used 
around his cabin. Sieving the gravel to remove the 
larger stones would be a fun project to keep the spirit 
of Dick at his cabin.  
Lee Fink, ranger and pilot for Lake Clark 
National Park, said he liked my work because, once 
finished, there was no sign of damage to the sur-
rounding scenery; he said it looked like the labor was 
done elsewhere, and the finished product put in place 
with a helicopter. When John Branson and I were fin-
ished no evidence of our work could be seen beyond 
the edge of the cabin.
I will mention two projects at Twin Lakes that 
epitomize many special collaborations. They were 
both my way of honoring the skilled craftsmanship 
of the Civilian Conservation Corp, from the Great 
Depression, that can still be found in our National 
Parks today. Both projects leave a little of myself, the 
people I worked with and the mentors I learned from.

dent Deb Leggett, Ranger/Pilot Lee Fink, Chief of

Epilogue
Maintenance Paul Button, and the Assistant Regional 
Director for the National Park Service in Alaska for a 
walk around Dick’s cabin and the other three cabins 
up the lake. They came to discuss the future of the 
cabins and how any restorations would support the 
goals for the site. There was no dissent about Dick’s 
cabin being restored as closely as possible to Dick’s 
original work. The historic nature of the other three 
cabins was acknowledged but everyone thought these 
three cabins should be considered in support of Dick’s 
legacy. Changes would be allowed to make these cab-
ins more livable for National Park Service seasonal 
staff. The changes made kept each cabin’s historic 
footprint and character.
While my friend Roger Moore visited during the 
restoration of Hope’s cabin in 2001, I wanted to incor-
porate the scribing and fitting of one irregular surface 
to another from the master log builder, Lee Cole, into 
my work at Twin Lakes. We removed a small spruce 
that was growing too close to Hope’s cabin and used it 
as a support post at the corner of the bunk bed, scrib-
ing the stump to fit on a rounded granite rock as a 
foundation.
When John Levendusky and Kevin Ruesch vis-
ited Dick’s cabin in 2005, they both wanted to help 
me with a project. The three of us used Dick’s No. 
241 Sandvikens saw to rip boards from a 9"-diameter 
spruce log. We then ripped the edges of the boards 
square. With a wooden handplane I made at a Fine 
Woodworking program with Jim Krenov I planed the 
edges to a tight fit. Tabletops for Spike’s cabin and for 
the ranger cabin on Lower Twin Lake were glued up 
using wooden wedges for pressure. The surface was 
flattened with the same wooden plane. 
Each of these two projects left my personal crafts-
manship rather than exactly replicating the original 
work within those cabins. I hope they will be appreci-
ated as an inspiration, as I was inspired by the craft I 
saw as a youth and by craftspersons who passed their 
skills to me.
The restoration of Dick’s cabin was a collaborative 
effort that would not have been possible without the 
expertise, input and labor of many people. Although 
I have done my best to recall each contributor here, I 
have almost certainly forgotten someone who assisted 
with the restoration through the years. It is not with 
intent. I appreciated the dedicated assistance of every-
one involved. The passion and labor everyone brought 
to these projects are testaments to the reverence felt by 
so many for Dick’s life and legacy.	
Visitors today will find Dick’s cabin looking much 
as it did when Dick left it. For me, though, after years 
of restoration work, the site and its structures feel very 
different today. I do not consider this a negative thing. 
I tried hard to replicate Dick’s work exactly, right 
down to every swing of his axe or push of his saw. 
But considering not just accuracy but also longevity 
meant that sometimes my work deviated from Dick’s 
original designs. My restorations are a continuation 
of Dick’s repairing, keeping things in good working 
order – much like he did with his snow shovel, ice 
creepers, bread pan or chimney cap when they needed 
his attention. 
What started for Dick as an adventure on the 
shore of Twin Lakes became a life in relationship with 
wildlife, wilderness and with the visitors who came to 
Spruce table at the ranger cabin on Lower Twin Lake.

meet him. Similarly, as I look back on the 19 years I 
spent as caretaker of Dick’s cabin, what stands out to 
me is not so much the labor as the relationships – to 
the many visitors I met, to the wilderness and animals 
of Twin Lakes, and to Dick’s lingering presence there. 
Throughout these restoration projects, my goal 
was always to keep Dick’s home from becoming a 
sterilized representation of what it had once been; 
I did this by keeping Dick’s spirit present with me 
as I worked. Dick’s story remains an inspiration to 
so many people today, and his cabin and tools are so 
much more than just artifacts of his life. If you ever 
have the opportunity to visit, I hope you’ll enjoy the 
sights – but more than that, I hope you too will feel 
Dick’s spirit present in his handcrafted life.
“I raked the beach one last time and with that,  
the operation got my stamp of approval.”
