    "text": "In this first episode, we're heading into the wild Yukon wilderness. We're going to show you one of the most dangerous survival challenges you've ever seen. Two years ago, a war veteran named James Lindqvist died. But before he left, he made his son Erik one final promise: finish the cabin.\n\nFifteen years ago, James came here seeking peace and escape. He wanted to build a place where he could leave behind the demons of war. But a terrible illness took him before he could finish. He died knowing his dream was in ruins.\n\nNow Erik is here to face something absolutely insane. He has the skills, he has the experience. But what he doesn't have is time. ONLY 90 days before winter becomes a killing machine. Ninety days before temperatures drop to -40°F. Before blizzards bury everything under meters of snow. Before one mistake means death.\n\nThis won't be a game. Erik has to build a functional cabin from scratch. He has to light a fire that keeps him alive. And he has to survive alone in one of the most hostile environments on the planet. Racing against the clock, against the weather, against the limits of his body. Because if he fails, he's trapped. No shelter, no heat, no way out.\n\nCan he really do it? Can one man build from scratch what his father couldn't? Or will the Yukon destroy him? We're going to see it all unfold right here.\n\nThis is about to begin.\n\nThis is The Last Shelter.",

Gus jumps from the truck and starts exploring. Erik walks toward the structure and stops. It's worse than he imagined. Much worse.\n\nIt's not a half-built cabin. It's a skeleton. A few foundation posts, rotted and sunk into the earth. A couple of base logs, broken and covered in moss. The rest is a pile of collapsed wood. Fifteen years of storms have completely destroyed his father's dream. No walls. No roof. Nothing.\n\nErik walks through the debris. He kicks a rotten log that crumbles into splinters. He can't go inside. There's no inside. It's just a heap of ruins exposed to the sky. Disappointment hits him, but quickly turns to determination. There's nothing to repair here. He has to start again. From scratch.\n\nHe sets up his tent thirty meters from the ruins, on higher ground. He organizes his tools in a pile covered with a tarp. Chainsaw, hand saw, axes, chisels, level, measuring tape. Everything he'll need to build a cabin from nothing.\n\nHe stops and looks at the ruins. The reality of the challenge settles in. Ninety days. That's all. Ninety days to build a complete cabin from scratch. To prepare for a winter that will come without mercy. He takes a deep breath. He begins.",

As he works, the cold intensifies. Temperature drops to 41°F. Autumn is coming to an end. Then he begins laying a new foundation of gravel and large stones. He levels each stone meticulously. A solid base is the key to everything.\n\nThe foundation is ready. Now he needs logs. He heads into the forest with his chainsaw. He chooses a tall, straight pine. The roar of the chainsaw fills the silent air. He makes the notch cut, then the back cut. The tree creaks, leans, and falls with a thunderous crash. The action is raw and powerful. He repeats the process. Over and over and over. He needs dozens of logs.\n\nErik drags the logs to the site using his old Ford pickup. He hooks a chain to the log and ties it to the rear bumper. The pickup engine roars. The wheels spin in the mud. The log drags slowly toward the site. He repeats the process over and over. The pickup is his most valuable tool. Without it, the work would be impossible.\n\nWhen the logs arrive at the site, he starts preparing them. He uses a drawknife to peel the bark in long strips. Bare, pale wood is exposed. Then, with incredible precision, he uses his axe and chisel to cut the notches at each end. Each notch must be perfect for the logs to fit.\n\nHe places the first base log on the stone foundation.
