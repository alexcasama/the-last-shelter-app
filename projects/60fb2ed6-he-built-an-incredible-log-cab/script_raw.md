## INTRO (0:00-1:30)

[HELICOPTER FLYING OVER YUKON - JACK LOOKING OUT, INTENSE]

**JACK** (speaking to camera, energetic, excited, urgent):

"In this first episode, we're heading into the wild Yukon wilderness. We're going to show you one of the most dangerous survival challenges you've ever seen. Two years ago, a war veteran named James Lindqvist died. But before he left, he made his son Erik one final promise: finish the cabin.

[CUT TO: Jack pointing downward, intense]

Fifteen years ago, James came here seeking peace and escape. He wanted to build a place where he could leave behind the demons of war. But a terrible illness took him before he could finish. He died knowing his dream was in ruins.

[CUT TO: Aerial view of the cabin in ruins - ZOOM IN, BRUTAL]

Now Erik is here to face something absolutely insane. He has the skills, he has the experience. But what he doesn't have is time. ONLY 90 days before winter becomes a killing machine. Ninety days before temperatures drop to -40°F. Before blizzards bury everything under meters of snow. Before one mistake means death.

[CUT TO: Mountains covered in snow, dark sky, storm approaching - EPIC AND BRUTAL]

This won't be a game. Erik has to build a functional cabin from scratch. He has to light a fire that keeps him alive. And he has to survive alone in one of the most hostile environments on the planet. Racing against the clock, against the weather, against the limits of his body. Because if he fails, he's trapped. No shelter, no heat, no way out.

[CUT TO: HELICOPTER LANDING - JACK STEPPING OUT, WALKING TOWARD THE SITE]

Can he really do it? Can one man build from scratch what his father couldn't? Or will the Yukon destroy him? We're going to see it all unfold right here.

[EPIC PAUSE]

This is about to begin.

This is The Last Shelter.

## PHASE 1: ARRIVAL AND DEVASTATION (1:30-3:30 | 2 min)

[DAY 1 - ERIK'S TRUCK ARRIVING AT THE SITE - EARLY MORNING]

Erik's truck arrives at the clearing after hours driving through the forest. When he steps out, the cold Yukon air hits him immediately, around 50°F. Gus jumps from the truck and starts exploring. Erik walks toward the structure and stops. It's worse than he imagined. Much worse.

It's not a half-built cabin. It's a skeleton. A few foundation posts, rotted and sunk into the earth. A couple of base logs, broken and covered in moss. The rest is a pile of collapsed wood. Fifteen years of storms have completely destroyed his father's dream. No walls. No roof. Nothing.

Erik walks through the debris. He kicks a rotten log that crumbles into splinters. He can't go inside. There's no inside. It's just a heap of ruins exposed to the sky. Disappointment hits him, but quickly turns to determination. There's nothing to repair here. He has to start again. From scratch.

He sets up his tent thirty meters from the ruins, on higher ground. He organizes his tools in a pile covered with a tarp. Chainsaw, hand saw, axes, chisels, level, measuring tape. Everything he'll need to build a cabin from nothing.

He stops and looks at the ruins. The reality of the challenge settles in. Ninety days. That's all. Ninety days to build a complete cabin from scratch. To prepare for a winter that will come without mercy. He takes a deep breath. He begins.

## JACK BREAK #1: THE CLOCK STARTS (3:30-4:00 | 30 sec)

[JACK STANDING ON THE SITE, CABIN RUINS IN THE BACKGROUND, LOOKING AT CAMERA]

**JACK:**

"Erik has ninety days. And he just discovered there's nothing to repair. The cabin is destroyed. Fifteen years of brutal weather have reduced it to rubble. He has to start from scratch. Clear the site. Build a new foundation. And fell every log he'll need. The clock isn't just running. It's against him."

---

## PHASE 2: FOUNDATION AND FIRST LOGS (4:00-10:30 | 6:30 min)

[DAYS 1-20: BUILDING FROM SCRATCH]

[DAY 1-5]

Erik starts demolition work. He uses a pry bar to separate the rotten logs. He drags them to a pile for firewood. The work is brutal and dusty. Each piece of old wood is a reminder of failure. He clears the area until only bare earth remains. The site is ready. Now, the real construction begins.

[DAY 6-10]

With the site cleared, Erik digs a new drainage ditch. The earth is hard, full of roots and rocks. But he knows it's essential. As he works, the cold intensifies. Temperature drops to 41°F. Autumn is coming to an end. Then he begins laying a new foundation of gravel and large stones. He levels each stone meticulously. A solid base is the key to everything.

[DAY 11-15]

The foundation is ready. Now he needs logs. He heads into the forest with his chainsaw. He chooses a tall, straight pine. The roar of the chainsaw fills the silent air. He makes the notch cut, then the back cut. The tree creaks, leans, and falls with a thunderous crash. The action is raw and powerful. He repeats the process. Over and over and over. He needs dozens of logs.

[DAY 16-20]

Erik drags the logs to the site using his old Ford pickup. He hooks a chain to the log and ties it to the rear bumper. The pickup engine roars. The wheels spin in the mud. The log drags slowly toward the site. He repeats the process over and over. The pickup is his most valuable tool. Without it, the work would be impossible.

When the logs arrive at the site, he starts preparing them. He uses a drawknife to peel the bark in long strips. Bare, pale wood is exposed. Then, with incredible precision, he uses his axe and chisel to cut the notches at each end. Each notch must be perfect for the logs to fit.

He places the first base log on the stone foundation. Then the second. They fit perfectly. The first pieces of the puzzle. Twenty days have passed and he only has the foundation. Winter is approaching. The pressure is immense.

## JACK BREAK #2: THE MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB (10:30-11:00 | 30 sec)

[JACK STANDING ON THE SITE, POINTING TO THE FIRST BASE LOGS, PARTIAL CABIN IN THE BACKGROUND]

**JACK:**

"Twenty days. Erik has spent twenty days just clearing the mess and placing the first logs. He felled the trees himself. He prepared each one by hand. But look at this. He's barely started. He has to raise entire walls, a roof, a chimney. And he's already spent nearly a quarter of his time. The mountain he has to climb is enormous."

---

## PHASE 3: RACING AGAINST THE FIRST COLD (11:00-18:00 | 7 min)

[DAYS 21-40: RAISING THE WALLS]

[DAY 21-30]

Erik starts raising the walls. Log after log. He uses his pickup to help lift the heavier logs. He hooks a chain to a log and slowly lifts it with the bumper. Then he positions it in place. He checks the level constantly. He makes sure each log fits perfectly in the notches. The walls begin to rise, inch by inch.

One morning, he wakes up and sees frost on the ground. The first frost of the season. A silent warning. Winter is coming. Time is running out. Every day that passes is one less day to work.

[DAY 31-35]

The walls reach waist height. Progress is visible, but slow. The weather worsens. Temperature drops to 32°F. The sky turns gray. There's a feeling that something is coming. Something that can't be stopped. Erik works faster, aware of the invisible threat approaching.

[DAY 36]

Early in the morning, the sky is dark gray and threatening. Wind begins to blow from the north. Erik feels the change in the air. He knows what's coming. A storm. A big one. He works frantically to secure his tent and his tools. He gathers firewood. He prepares his shelter. The wind intensifies.

---

## JACK BREAK #3: UNEXPECTED STORM (18:00-18:45 | 45 sec)

[JACK STANDING ON THE SITE, LOOKING AT THE DARK, THREATENING SKY, HALF-BUILT CABIN IN THE BACKGROUND]

**JACK:**

"Day thirty-six. Erik has been working for thirty-six days straight. The walls are reaching waist height. But the weather just changed. A massive storm is coming from the north. This wasn't in the plan. This wasn't expected. Temperatures are dropping to -4°F. Wind is reaching speeds of forty miles per hour. Erik is going to have to stop. He's going to lose days. Days he can't afford to lose."

---

## PHASE 4: STORM AND LOST TIME (18:45-22:00 | 3:15 min)

[DAYS 36-40: 4-DAY STORM]

[DAY 36 - AFTERNOON]

The storm hits with fury. Blinding snow. Brutal wind. Temperatures drop to -4°F. Erik retreats to his tent. He lights a small heater. He curls up in his sleeping bag. Gus presses against him. Outside, the wind howls like a wounded animal. The tent sways. But it holds.

[DAY 37]

The storm continues. Snow and wind without stopping. Erik can't work. He can't see more than a few meters. He can't move without risk of getting lost. He stays in the tent. He eats. He sleeps. He waits. He looks at the calendar. Day thirty-seven of ninety. Thirty-seven days spent. Fifty-three days left. The pressure is almost unbearable.

[DAY 38]

The storm continues. Snow piling up. Erik goes out briefly to check his construction site. The logs are covered in snow. The foundation is covered in snow. Everything is covered. He returns to his tent. There's nothing to do. Just wait.

[DAY 39]

Finally, the wind begins to ease. The snow stops. But the damage is done. He's lost four days. Four days he can't get back. Four days that bring him closer to the limit. Erik exits his tent. The site is transformed. Everything is buried under snow. He starts clearing the area. He removes snow from the logs. He cleans the site. It's tedious and depressing work.

[DAY 40]

Finally, he can get back to work. But the storm has left its mark. Temperature is now 5°F. The sky is grayer. Winter is here. It's not a future threat. It's a brutal reality. Erik places the next log. And the next. He works with renewed urgency. He knows he can't afford another delay.

---

## JACK BREAK #4: PRESSURE MOUNTING (22:00-22:45 | 45 sec)

[JACK STANDING ON THE SITE, LOOKING AT SNOW-COVERED LOGS, PARTIAL WALLS IN THE BACKGROUND]

**JACK:**

"Forty days. Erik just lost four days to an unexpected storm. Four days when he couldn't work. Four days he can't get back. The walls are almost complete, but he has only fifty days left. The storm has accelerated the clock. Winter is coming faster than he expected. Erik has to work faster. He has to take more risks. Or the Yukon will win."

---

## PHASE 5: FINAL PUSH TO THE ROOF (22:45-26:00 | 3:15 min)

[DAYS 41-55: FINISHING WALLS AND STARTING ROOF]

[DAY 41-50]

Erik works with desperate urgency. He places log after log. The walls rise faster now. He knows he has to finish the walls before another storm hits. He works in temperatures dropping to -4°F. His hands are frozen. His body screams. But he continues.

The pickup is constantly in use. Lifting logs. Positioning them. Removing them if they don't fit. It's a working machine. Without the pickup, progress would be impossible.

[DAY 51-55]

The walls are finally complete. All four walls are standing. It's a major milestone. But there's no time to celebrate. He immediately starts working on the roof frame. He places the ridge beam, a massive log. The work is dangerous. The log weighs almost 700 pounds. He slowly lifts it with the pickup. He checks that it's perfectly aligned. He places wooden wedges to secure it.

---

## PHASE 6: ROOF IN EXTREME CONDITIONS (26:00-29:00 | 3 min)

[DAYS 56-75: ROOF AND WATERPROOFING]

[DAY 56-65]

He starts cutting and placing the roof rafters. Each rafter must be cut at a precise angle. He uses his hand saw. The work is meticulous. One mistake and the roof won't be watertight. Temperature is now -13°F. The sky is darker. There's a feeling that time is running out.

[DAY 66-70]

He places wooden boards over the rafters. He creates the base for waterproofing. He works on the roof in extreme cold. Wind pushes him. His fingers are numb. But he continues. He nails board after board.

[DAY 71-75]

Now the waterproofing. Tar paper and shingles. He works on the frost-covered roof. The work is tedious, but vital. He nails shingle after shingle. Winter is here. Temperatures drop to -22°F. Snow is constant.

---

## PHASE 7: CHIMNEY AND FINISHING (29:00-29:45 | 45 sec)

[DAYS 76-88: CHIMNEY AND DETAILS]

[DAY 76-85]

Erik starts building the chimney. He collects stones from a frozen creek bed. He transports them with his pickup. He places each stone carefully. The mortar freezes almost instantly. He works in small sections. The chimney rises slowly. Stone by stone. In extreme cold.

[DAY 86-88]

The chimney is complete. Erik spends the last days sealing every crack with moss and mud. He installs a makeshift door. He accumulates a huge pile of firewood. The cabin is ready. It's rustic. It's imperfect. But it's a shelter.

---

## PHASE 8: FIRST FIRE (29:45-30:00 | 15 sec)

[DAY 89-90 - NIGHT]

Erik lights the first fire in the chimney. Flames grow, filling the cabin with heat and light. Smoke rises up the chimney. Outside, a blizzard rages. Temperature plummets to -40°F. But inside, for the first time, there is heat. There is safety. There is home.

He sits in front of the fire, completely exhausted. Gus curls up at his side. Suddenly, he hears the sound of an engine. An old truck stops outside. His uncle steps out and enters. He looks around, amazed. He touches the solid log walls. His eyes fill with tears.

"You did it," he says simply.

They sit together in front of the fire. The promise has been fulfilled.

---

## OUTRO

**JACK** (voice over):

"Ninety days. Erik Lindqvist did the impossible. He built a cabin from scratch, alone, in the heart of the Yukon winter. He faced time, weather, and his own limits. He lost days to an unexpected storm. But he didn't give up. And he won. His father's dream wasn't just finished. It was rebuilt. The promise was kept.

This is The Last Shelter."
